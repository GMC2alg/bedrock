      "This process replicates an existing cube. It can include data & rules
      too. Use case: Intended for development/prototyping. 1. Take a snapshot of cube
      data copying all rules to values. 2. Take an exact copy of a cube in a 'one click
      action' as a starting point for prototyping rule changes or developing new features."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary purpose of this process?
        answer: This process is primarily intended for development and prototyping purposes.
      - question: Can the process include data and rules?
        answer: Yes, the process can include both data and rules.
      - question: What is the first step in using this process?
        answer:
          The first step is taking a snapshot of cube data by copying all rules
          to values.
  - context:
      There are parameter options to include data (pIncludeData) and rules (pIncludeRules)
      with the creation of the cube. If the source cube (pSrcCube) is left blank or
      doesn't exist in the model, the process will terminate without doing anything.
      If the target cube (pTgtCube) already exists in the model, the process will terminate
      without doing anything.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the parameter options available for this process?
        answer:
          The parameter options available are to include data (pIncludeData) and
          rules (pIncludeRules).
      - question: What happens if the source cube is left blank?
        answer:
          If the source cube is left blank or doesn't exist, the process will terminate
          without doing anything.
      - question: Will the process proceed if the target cube already exists?
        answer:
          No, the process will terminate without doing anything if the target cube
          already exists.
  - context:
      If the target cube is left blank or is the same as the source cube, the
      cloned cube will inherit the source cube name with '_Clone' appended. If the source
      cube data only needs to be partially copied, then the pFilter parameter should
      be entered.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the target cube is left blank?
        answer:
          If the target cube is left blank, the cloned cube will inherit the source
          cube name with '_Clone' appended.
      - question: How can partial data be copied from the source cube?
        answer: Partial data can be copied from the source cube by using the pFilter parameter.
      - question: What suffix is appended to the source cube name when cloning?
        answer: The suffix '_Clone' is appended to the source cube name when cloning.
  - context:
      In productive systems, this process may be called internally by other processes
      (}bedrock.cube.data.copy, }bedrock.cube.data.copy.intercube) if copying data via
      intermediate cloned cubes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Can this process be used in productive systems?
        answer:
          Yes, this process can be used in productive systems where it may be called
          internally by other processes.
      - question: Which processes might call this process internally?
        answer:
          Processes like }bedrock.cube.data.copy and }bedrock.cube.data.copy.intercube
          might call this process internally.
      - question: Is this process involved in cloning cubes?
        answer:
          Yes, this process can be involved in cloning cubes, sometimes via intermediate
          cloned cubes.
  - context:
      Create an IBM Turbo Integrator process that allows for the replication
      of an existing cube. The process should offer options to include data and rules.
      This process mainly serves development and prototyping purposes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary function of the IBM Turbo Integrator process?
        answer:
          The primary function of the IBM Turbo Integrator process is to allow for
          the replication of an existing cube.
      - question: Is the IBM Turbo Integrator process suitable for production use?
        answer:
          While the process can be used in production environments, it is mainly
          intended for development and prototyping purposes.
      - question: What options does the process offer for cube replication?
        answer: The process offers options to include both data and rules for cube replication.
