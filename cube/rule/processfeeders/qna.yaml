  - context: This process reprocesses feeders when consolidated totals are not
      adding up. Intended for Development or production, it is used any time
      feeders need to be reprocessed, such as when new elements are added to any
      of the dimensions. A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory; otherwise, the
      process will abort. Wildcards and lists are acceptable. This process will
      process feeders for a cube.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The purpose of this process is to reprocess feeders when consolidated
          totals are not adding up. It is intended for development or production
          use.
      - question: When should this process be used?
        answer: This process should be used anytime feeders need to be reprocessed, such
          as when new elements are added to any of the dimensions.
      - question: What is necessary for this process to execute successfully?
        answer: A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory; otherwise, the process will
          abort.
  - context: The process checks if a wildcard has been used to specify the Cube name
      and creates a subset of cubes using a wildcard. If a delimited list of
      cube names includes wildcards, the subset might be reused multiple times.
      If the cube exists, the process proceeds to reprocess the feeders.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle wildcard cube names?
        answer: The process checks for wildcards and creates a subset of cubes. If a
          delimited list includes wildcards, the subset might be reused multiple
          times.
      - question: What happens if the cube exists?
        answer: If the cube exists, the process will proceed to reprocess the feeders
          for that cube.
      - question: What is created if wildcards are used?
        answer: A subset of cubes is created when wildcards are used to specify the cube
          name.
  - context: The process uses global variables to store process details, logging
      messages with specific error levels, and logs the execution with
      parameters. If errors are found, the process might quit or break depending
      on error handling settings.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What role do global variables play in this process?
        answer: Global variables are used to store process details and control flow,
          such as the return code and logging messages.
      - question: How is logging managed in this process?
        answer: Logging messages are created with specific error levels. The process
          logs execution details with parameters if enabled.
      - question: What happens if errors are found during the process?
        answer: If errors are found, the process might quit or break, depending on the
          strict error handling settings.
document_outline: The Turbo Integrator process for reprocessing feeders includes
  descriptions of its purpose, usage scenarios, parameter handling, logging, and
  error management.
