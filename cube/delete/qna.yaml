- context: This process deletes cube(s). Intended for cleaning up after development/prototyping.
    Delete all cubes not needed after Go Live. A list of cubes can be specified and/or
    wild cards can be used. Valid cube name(s) must be specified otherwise the process
    will abort. By default (pCtrlObj) the process will not delete control cubes (i.e.
    attributes, security etc).
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the deletion process?
    answer: The process is intended for cleaning up cubes that are not needed after
      development or prototyping, specifically after Go Live.
  - question: Can the process delete control cubes?
    answer: By default, the process will not delete control cubes such as attributes
      or security cubes, unless explicitly specified.
  - question: What must be specified for the process to delete cubes?
    answer: Valid cube name(s) must be specified for the process to proceed. If invalid
      names are provided, the process will abort.
- context: pDelim is used as a delimiter, and if not specified, defaults to '&'. If
    no cubes are specified, an error is logged. If a cube name does not contain a
    wildcard or delimiter and is invalid, an error is logged.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the default delimiter for cube names?
    answer: The default delimiter is '&' if none is specified.
  - question: What happens if no cubes are specified?
    answer: An error message is logged indicating that no cubes were specified.
  - question: What occurs if an invalid cube name is given?
    answer: An error message is logged specifying that the cube name is invalid.
- context: The process allows for the use of wildcards to specify cube names. If wildcards
    are used, an MDX expression is created to handle the cubes that match the pattern,
    allowing for bulk operations.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What functionality does using a wildcard provide?
    answer: Using a wildcard allows the process to handle multiple cubes matching
      the pattern, enabling bulk operations.
  - question: How are cubes handled when wildcards are used?
    answer: When wildcards are used, an MDX expression is created to manage cubes
      that match the specified pattern.
  - question: What is the benefit of using wildcard expressions?
    answer: Wildcard expressions enable efficient handling and deletion of multiple
      cubes simultaneously.
- context: The process logs output based on specified parameters. A message log is
    created with details like user, process name, and parameters when pLogoutput is
    enabled.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens when pLogoutput is enabled?
    answer: When pLogoutput is enabled, a log is created containing details about
      the user, process name, and specified parameters.
  - question: What information is included in the log message?
    answer: The log message includes user details, process name, the parameter pCube,
      delimiter pDelim, and control object setting pCtrlObj.
  - question: Why is logging important in this process?
    answer: Logging is important for monitoring the process execution, for error tracking,
      and for auditing purposes.
- context: Error handling is implemented, logging errors when conditions are not met
    and providing options for strict error handling or process break.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process handle errors?
    answer: The process logs errors when issues are detected and provides options
      for strict error handling to abort or break the process.
  - question: What is strict error handling?
    answer: Strict error handling ensures the process quits immediately upon encountering
      an error.
  - question: What happens if an error occurs but strict error handling is not enforced?
    answer: If strict error handling is not enforced, the process might log the error
      and proceed by breaking or attempting recovery.
