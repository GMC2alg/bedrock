- context: This process creates a processing view for the cube and for specified dimensions
    of the cube. It is intended for development/prototyping or in Production environment.
    The process creates empty subsets and assigns them to the view. A subsequent process
    is required to insert elements into subsets otherwise the views will not contain
    any data. A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory, otherwise the process will abort.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process create?
    answer: The Turbo Integrator process creates a processing view for the cube and
      for specified dimensions of the cube.
  - question: Is a valid cube name mandatory for the process?
    answer: Yes, a valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory, otherwise the process will
      abort.
  - question: What is required after creating the view with empty subsets?
    answer: A subsequent process is required to insert elements into subsets; otherwise,
      the views will not contain any data.
- context: The code checks various parameters for validation, such as cube name, dimensions,
    and suppression parameters. It ensures that each is correctly specified, logging
    errors when any are missing or incorrect. The process uses tokens and MDX expressions
    to navigate and manipulate the cube and dimensions based on input parameters.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What parameters does the code validate?
    answer: The code validates parameters such as cube name, dimensions, and suppression
      parameters.
  - question: What happens if parameters are missing or incorrect?
    answer: Errors are logged when parameters are missing or incorrect.
  - question: How does the process handle navigation and manipulation?
    answer: The process uses tokens and MDX expressions to navigate and manipulate
      the cube and dimensions based on input parameters.
- context: The process uses conditional logic to handle cube and dimension lists,
    utilizing constructs like 'While' and 'If' to iterate through and perform actions
    only if conditions are met. This ensures that the correct subsets and views are
    created and managed efficiently, including handling of the 'ALL' keyword for comprehensive
    operations.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What programming constructs does the process use for logic handling?
    answer: The process uses conditional logic with constructs like 'While' and 'If'.
  - question: Does the process handle both cube and dimension lists?
    answer: Yes, it handles both cube and dimension lists.
  - question: What does the 'ALL' keyword signify in the process?
    answer: The 'ALL' keyword is used for comprehensive operations on cubes or dimensions.
- context: The process checks if views or subsets exist and, if they do, deletes them
    before creating new ones. This is, in part, to ensure that no duplicated or conflicting
    entries interfere with the view creation and to maintain data integrity throughout
    the process lifecycle.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the process do if views or subsets already exist?
    answer: If views or subsets already exist, the process deletes them before creating
      new ones.
  - question: Why does the process delete existing views or subsets?
    answer: This ensures that no duplicated or conflicting entries interfere with
      the view creation and maintains data integrity.
  - question: How does the process maintain data integrity?
    answer: By deleting existing views or subsets before creating new ones, ensuring
      no duplication or conflicts.
- context: After processing, the code handles error logging and return codes, preparing
    messages based on whether errors occurred. If strict error handling is enabled,
    the process quits upon errors; otherwise, it breaks the process flow slightly
    to notify but continue.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process handle errors?
    answer: Errors are logged, and if strict error handling is enabled, the process
      quits. Otherwise, it slightly breaks the flow but continues after logging the
      error.
  - question: What determines if the process quits on errors?
    answer: Whether strict error handling is enabled determines if the process quits
      on errors.
  - question: Does the process continue after logging an error when strict error handling
      is not enabled?
    answer: Yes, the process continues after logging an error if strict error handling
      is not enabled.
