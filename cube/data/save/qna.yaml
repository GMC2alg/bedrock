- context: 'This IBM Turbo Integrator process is used to save data to disk for the cubes 
      specified in the parameters. Use case: Intended for Development or production 
      environments. This process would be used any time data for a specific cube needs 
      to be saved (i.e.: After a data loading to save a specific cube or for manual entry cubes). 
      Note: A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory otherwise the process will abort. 
      Wildcards and lists are acceptable. This process saves the data for a cube.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: When would you use this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: You would use this process any time data for a specific cube needs to be saved, 
      such as after loading data or for manual entry cubes.
  - question: What parameter is mandatory for this process?
    answer: A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory, otherwise the process will abort.
  - question: What is the purpose of this process?
    answer: This process is used to save data to disk for the cubes specified in the parameters.
