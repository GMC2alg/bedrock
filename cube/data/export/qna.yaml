- context: 'The Turbo Integrator process is designed to export data from a specified
    cube to a flat file for a given 'slice' (any dimension/element combination).
    This process is intended for both development/prototyping and production environments.
    The main use cases include exporting data for inclusion in another TM1 model to
    eliminate locking possibilities and exporting data for processing in an ERP system.
    Note: A valid cube name (pCube) is required, otherwise, the process will abort.
    All other parameters are optional, but the filter (pFilter) should be specified
    to limit the file size. The default output path is the same as the error file
    path. As this TI uses a view as a data source, implicit variables such as NValue,
    SValue, and Value_is_String are necessary. To edit this TI in Architect, a temporary
    cube with at least 24 dimensions is needed as the preview data source or the data
    source should be set to ASCII and the TI file should be manually edited to add
    back the required implicit view variables.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The Turbo Integrator process is designed to export data from a specified
      cube to a flat file for a given 'slice' (any dimension/element combination)
      and is used for development/prototyping or in production environments.
  - question: What happens if a valid cube name is not specified?
    answer: If a valid cube name (pCube) is not specified, the process will abort.
  - question: What should be done to edit this TI in Architect?
    answer: To edit this TI in Architect, a temporary cube with at least 24 dimensions
      is needed as the preview data source, or the data source should be set to ASCII
      and the TI file should be manually edited to add back the required implicit
      view variables.
- context: 'If using the pFilterParallel parameter, the single dimension used as the
    'parallelization slicer' cannot appear in the pFilter parameter. When using
    parallelization via the *RunProcess* function, the elements listed in pFilterParallel
    will be split one at a time and passed to a recursive call of the process being
    added to pFilter. Each element name will also be appended to the filename. Warning:
    As the *RunProcess* function currently has no mechanism to check the state of
    the called process if more processes are released than available CPU cores on
    the server, then this could lead to TM1 consuming all available server resources
    and an associated performance issue.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Can the parallelization slicer dimension appear in the pFilter parameter?
    answer: No, the single dimension used as the 'parallelization slicer' cannot appear
      in the pFilter parameter if using the pFilterParallel parameter.
  - question: What happens when using parallelization via the *RunProcess* function?
    answer: When using parallelization via the *RunProcess* function, the elements
      listed in pFilterParallel will be split one at a time, and added to pFilter,
      with each element name appended to the filename.
  - question: What is a potential risk of using the *RunProcess* function without
      proper checks?
    answer: The potential risk is consuming all available server resources and causing
      a performance issue if more processes are released than the available CPU cores
      on the server.
