  - context:
      This process automatically creates a cube based on a delimited string of
      dimension names. Intended for development/prototyping, it can be used to quickly
      create a cube for a demo or development. The pDims parameter contains the dimension
      list and is mandatory. The format of the pDims parameter uses '&' as a delimiter
      (e.g. Dim1 & Dim2 & Dim3). Spaces are ignored to enhance readability. The order
      of the dimension list specifies the initial index order of dimensions in the cube.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer:
          The process is used to automatically create a cube based on a delimited
          string of dimension names, mainly for development or prototyping purposes.
      - question: How should the dimension list be formatted?
        answer:
          The dimension list should be formatted with '&' as a delimiter, like 'Dim1
          & Dim2 & Dim3'. Spaces are ignored for readability.
      - question: What determines the index order of dimensions in the cube?
        answer:
          The order of the dimension list determines the initial index order of
          dimensions in the cube.
  - context:
      "The pRecreate parameter is optional for creating new cubes: If a cube
      already exists and pRecreate is set to 0, then the process will abort. If a cube
      already exists and pRecreate is set to 1, then the process will destroy the old
      cube and recreate it with the specified dimensionality."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if a cube already exists and pRecreate is set to 0?
        answer: If a cube already exists and pRecreate is set to 0, the process will abort.
      - question: What happens if a cube already exists and pRecreate is set to 1?
        answer:
          If a cube already exists and pRecreate is set to 1, the process will destroy
          the old cube and recreate it with the specified dimensionality.
      - question: Is the pRecreate parameter mandatory?
        answer: No, the pRecreate parameter is optional.
  - context:
      The code sets a maximum of 100 dimensions. If the number of dimensions
      exceeds this, the process logs an error message and increments the error count.
      It then checks if pStrictErrorHandling is set to 1 to decide whether to quit or
      break the process.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the maximum number of dimensions allowed?
        answer: The maximum number of dimensions allowed is 100.
      - question: What happens if the number of dimensions exceeds 100?
        answer:
          If the number of dimensions exceeds 100, an error message is logged, and
          the error count is incremented.
      - question: How does the process decide whether to quit or break after an error?
        answer:
          The process checks if pStrictErrorHandling is set to 1 to decide whether
          to quit or break.
  - context:
      The process uses a loop to split the delimited dimension list and check
      each dimension. If a dimension exists, it increments the dimension counter and
      assigns the dimension to the appropriate variable. If not recognized, it logs
      an error message.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How are the dimensions split and checked?
        answer:
          The dimensions are split using a loop that checks each dimension. If recognized,
          it increments the counter; otherwise, it logs an error.
      - question: What happens when a dimension is recognized?
        answer:
          When a dimension is recognized, the dimension counter is incremented,
          and the dimension is assigned to a variable.
      - question: What is logged if a dimension is not recognized?
        answer: An error message is logged if a dimension is not recognized.
  - context:
      On successful completion with no errors, the process logs a success message.
      If there are errors, it logs that the process completed with errors and advises
      checking the log for more details.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process log on successful completion?
        answer:
          On successful completion, it logs a success message stating the process
          successfully created the cube with the specified dimensions.
      - question: What happens if errors are encountered during the process?
        answer:
          If errors are encountered, the process logs that it completed with errors
          and advises checking the log for more details.
      - question: How is the completion status communicated?
        answer:
          The completion status is communicated via log messages indicating success
          or errors.
