- context: 'This process converts a private view to a public view for the named client.
    Use case: Intended for development/prototyping or production. 1. Make private
    view public to enable public consumption. Note: * A valid cube name pCube is mandatory
    otherwise the process will abort. * Also, a valid view name pView is mandatory
    otherwise the process will abort. * This process must be run by the user owning
    the private view; it cannot be run by another user. * If the view contains private
    subsets they must also be made public or the view publish will fail.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The main purpose of this process is to convert a private view to a public
      view for a specified client, making it publicly accessible.
  - question: What conditions must be met for the process to successfully convert
      a view from private to public?
    answer: A valid cube name (pCube) and a valid view name (pView) must be specified;
      the process must be executed by the user who owns the private view, and any
      private subsets within the view must also be made public.
  - question: In what scenarios is this process intended to be used?
    answer: The process is intended for use in development, prototyping, or production
      scenarios.
- context: 'Validate Cube: If a cube name is not specified or does not exist, the
    process will log an error and terminate if strict error handling is enabled. Validate
    view: A view name must also be specified. No direct way to check if private view
    exists except via file system. Parameters Publish Private Subsets and Overwrite:
    Ensure they are valid values. If Overwrite is set to 0 and a public view with
    the same name exists, an error is logged.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if a cube name is not provided or does not exist?
    answer: The process will log an error and terminate if strict error handling is
      enabled.
  - question: What are the validation steps before publishing the view?
    answer: 1. Validate that a cube name is provided and exists. 2. Validate that
      a view name is provided. 3. Ensure parameters for publishing private subsets
      and overwriting views are valid.
  - question: How does the process handle an overwrite situation where a public view
      of the same name already exists?
    answer: If Overwrite is set to 0 and a public view of the same name already exists,
      the process logs an error.
document_outline: This document describes an IBM Turbo Integrator process to convert
  a private view to a public view, including validation steps, constraints, and possible
  error conditions.
