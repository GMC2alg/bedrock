- context: The IBM Turbo Integrator process is designed to create a dynamic view from
    an MDX expression that evaluates to a non-empty set in the specified dimension.
    This is suitable for development/prototyping or production environments. Its main
    use cases include creating a view to zero out data and creating a view to be used
    as a source for exporting or copying data. A valid cube name (pCube) is mandatory,
    as the process will abort if not provided. If the MDX expression doesn't compile
    or results in an empty set, the process will end with an error. The parameter
    (pTemp) controls whether the view is temporary (value 1) or permanently retained
    (value 0).
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main function of the IBM Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The main function of the IBM Turbo Integrator process is to create a dynamic
      view from an MDX expression that evaluates to a non-empty set in the specified
      dimension.
  - question: What are the primary use cases for this IBM Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The primary use cases include creating a view to zero out data and creating
      a view as a source for exporting or copying data.
  - question: What happens if a valid cube name is not provided in this process?
    answer: If a valid cube name (pCube) is not provided, the process will abort.
- context: A valid cube name is essential for the IBM Turbo Integrator process to
    run. If the MDX expression does not compile or results in an empty set, this will
    result in an error. The pTemp parameter allows users to specify if the view should
    be temporary or permanent, with 1 indicating temporary and 0 indicating permanent.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Why is a valid cube name necessary for the process?
    answer: A valid cube name is necessary because the process will abort without
      it.
  - question: What does the parameter pTemp control?
    answer: The parameter pTemp controls whether the view is temporary (value 1) or
      permanently retained (value 0).
  - question: What error condition could occur with the MDX expression?
    answer: An error will occur if the MDX expression does not compile or results
      in an empty set.
- context: In this Turbo Integrator process, it's crucial to validate parameters such
    as pCube, pView, and pMDXExpr to ensure the process executes correctly. The process
    includes error handling and logging to capture any issues that arise. If an error
    is detected, the system can either quit or break the process based on strict error
    handling settings.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What parameters need validation in the Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The parameters that need validation include pCube, pView, and pMDXExpr.
  - question: How does the process handle errors?
    answer: The process includes error handling and logging to capture any issues.
      It can either quit or break the process depending on the strict error handling
      settings.
  - question: What is pStrictErrorHandling's role in this process?
    answer: pStrictErrorHandling determines whether the process quits or breaks when
      errors are detected.
document_outline: This document describes the function and usage of an IBM Turbo Integrator
  process designed to create dynamic views from MDX expressions, including parameter
  validation, error handling, and logging.
