- context: 'This process deletes public views. Use case: Intended for development/prototyping
    or production. After a view has been created to zero or as a data source it needs
    to be deleted. Clean up public views after Go Live. This process can work on a
    single cubes or multiple cubes. This process can work on a single view or multiple
    views. When specifying view names wildcards can be included by using the * character.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the process described?
    answer: The process is designed to delete public views in a development, prototyping,
      or production environment after their purpose has been fulfilled.
  - question: Can the process handle multiple cubes and views?
    answer: Yes, the process can manage and delete views from both single and multiple
      cubes, as well as from single or multiple views.
  - question: How can wildcards be used in this process?
    answer: Wildcards can be included in view names by using the * character, allowing
      for flexible pattern matching.
- context: 'Parameter pCube: To specify which cubes to delete views from use the pCubes
    parameter. To delete views from a single cube only just specify that cube name
    e.g. Sales. To delete views from multiple cubes specify each cube name separated
    by a delimiter e.g. Sales&Inventory&Cashflow. To delete views from all cubes then
    set pCubes as *.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How do you delete views from multiple cubes?
    answer: 'Specify each cube name separated by a delimiter, for example: Sales&Inventory&Cashflow.'
  - question: What does setting the pCubes parameter to * do?
    answer: Setting pCubes to * instructs the process to delete views from all cubes.
  - question: What happens if an invalid cube is specified?
    answer: Invalid cubes are skipped, and the process continues with the other cubes.
- context: 'Parameter pView: To specify which views to delete use the pViews parameter.
    This parameter must be specified, a blank value will cause the process to terminate.
    To delete a single view only just specify that view name e.g. SalesByProduct.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Is it mandatory to specify the pViews parameter?
    answer: Yes, failing to specify the pViews parameter will cause the process to
      terminate.
  - question: Can multiple views be deleted in one operation?
    answer: Yes, by specifying each view name separated by a delimiter.
  - question: What happens if a blank value is provided for pView?
    answer: The process will terminate if pView is left blank.
- context: 'Parameter pDelim: The delimiter can be used when specifying multiple cubes
    and/or multiple views. The default delimiter is &. Any delimiter can be used by
    specifying a value for pDelimiter.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the default delimiter used in the process?
    answer: The default delimiter is &.
  - question: Can the delimiter be changed?
    answer: Yes, any suitable delimiter can be specified via the pDelimiter parameter.
  - question: Why would you change the default delimiter?
    answer: A different delimiter may be chosen to avoid conflicts with characters
      in wildcard search strings or cube names.
- context: The process can skip invalid cubes but will continue with valid ones. It
    also includes error handling; if there are errors, processes can either quit or
    break based on strict error handling settings.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Does the process continue if there are invalid cubes?
    answer: Yes, the process skips invalid cubes and continues with valid ones.
  - question: What happens if there are errors during the process?
    answer: If strict error handling is enabled, the process will quit; otherwise,
      it will break and continue where possible.
  - question: Is there a mechanism for handling errors in this process?
    answer: Yes, it includes error handling that can either quit or break the process
      based on configured error handling settings.

  an explanation of the use of wildcards, and the roles of parameters like pCube,
  pView, and pDelim.
