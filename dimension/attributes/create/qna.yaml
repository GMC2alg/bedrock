  - context: "This process can insert one or more attributes in one or more
      specified dimensions. Use case: Intended for development/prototyping. Add
      multiple dimension attributes. Delimited lists and/or wildcard (*) are
      acceptable for pDim & pAttr. Naturally, valid dimension name(s) (pDim) are
      mandatory otherwise the process will abort. Known limitation: This process
      can insert multiple attributes to multiple dimensions but only for a
      single attribute type."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary use case for this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The primary use case is for development and prototyping by inserting
          multiple attributes into specified dimensions.
      - question: What are acceptable formats for pDim and pAttr?
        answer: Delimited lists and/or wildcard (*) are acceptable formats for pDim and
          pAttr.
      - question: What is a limitation of this process?
        answer: This process can add multiple attributes to multiple dimensions but only
          supports a single attribute type.
  - context: A known limitation of this process is that it can insert multiple
      attributes to multiple dimensions but only for a single attribute type.
      Valid dimension names (pDim) are mandatory, otherwise, the process will
      terminate. The process uses global variables for logging and return codes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if an invalid dimension name is provided?
        answer: If an invalid dimension name is provided, the process will terminate.
      - question: How does the process handle errors?
        answer: The process uses global variables for logging errors and determining
          return codes, potentially terminating if errors occur.
      - question: What does the process log?
        answer: The process logs details such as error messages, user information, and
          process parameters.
  - context: If the parameter for delimiter (pDelim) is blank, it defaults to '&'.
      The process checks for errors before continuing. If multiple dimensions or
      attributes are specified with a wildcard, the process will create a subset
      to loop through the dimensions.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the default delimiter if none is specified?
        answer: If no delimiter is specified, the default delimiter is '&'.
      - question: What does the process do when using a wildcard in dimension names?
        answer: When using a wildcard, the process creates a subset to loop through the
          dimensions that match the wildcard pattern.
      - question: Does the process continue if there are errors?
        answer: The process checks for errors before continuing and may terminate or
          break if errors are present.
  - context: The process logs errors using a specific error message format and may
      break or quit if errors occur, depending on strict error handling
      settings. It provides detailed logging information for debugging purposes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What determines whether the process breaks or quits on error?
        answer: The strict error handling settings determine whether the process breaks
          or quits when errors occur.
      - question: What kind of information is logged by the process for debugging?
        answer: The process logs detailed information such as the process name, user,
          error messages, and parameters used during execution.
      - question: Is a specific error message format used in logging?
        answer: Yes, the process uses a specific error message format for logging
          errors.
  - context: The process involves looping through dimensions in pDim and attributes
      in pAttr using specified delimiters. It checks for existing attributes
      before inserting new ones to prevent duplication.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process prevent duplication of attributes?
        answer: The process checks for existing attributes in the dimension before
          inserting new ones to prevent duplication.
      - question: How are dimensions and attributes looped through?
        answer: Dimensions and attributes are looped through using specified delimiters,
          and subsets are created for wildcard entries.
      - question: What mechanism is used to handle attribute insertion?
        answer: The process uses the AttrInsert function to handle attribute insertion
          if the attribute doesn't already exist.
document_outline: This document describes a Turbo Integrator process that
  inserts attributes into dimensions as part of software development and
  prototyping. It outlines the process's capabilities, limitations, error
  handling, and logging procedures.
