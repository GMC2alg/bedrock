  - context: This process deletes a dimension, list of dimensions, or set of
      dimensions specified by wildcard name match. It is intended for
      development/prototyping and can be used during active agile development to
      remove dimensions due to renaming, change of requirements, etc. It can
      also be used to clean up unused dimensions prior to system Go Live. A
      valid dimension name pDim or list thereof is mandatory; otherwise, the
      process will abort. Attribute dimensions are excluded since they are
      automatically cleaned up by removing the base dimension.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this process?
        answer: The process is intended for development or prototyping, especially
          during agile development, to remove dimensions due to renaming or
          change of requirements. It can also be used to clean up unused
          dimensions before the system Go Live.
      - question: What happens if a valid dimension name is not provided?
        answer: If a valid dimension name pDim or list thereof is not provided, the
          process will abort.
      - question: Are attribute dimensions included in the deletion process?
        answer: No, attribute dimensions are excluded because they are automatically
          cleaned up by removing the base dimension.
  - context: Global variables include sProcessReturnCode and nProcessReturnCode with
      nProcessReturnCode initialized to 0. Constants such as cThisProcName,
      cUserName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt, cTempSub, cMsgErrorLevel, and
      cMsgErrorContent are defined to facilitate logging and process monitoring.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of global variables in the process?
        answer: Global variables like sProcessReturnCode and nProcessReturnCode are used
          to track the process execution status, with nProcessReturnCode
          initialized to 0 to indicate no errors initially.
      - question: What constants are used for logging and monitoring the process?
        answer: Constants such as cThisProcName, cUserName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt,
          cTempSub, cMsgErrorLevel, and cMsgErrorContent are used for logging
          and monitoring purposes.
      - question: How is random integer generation used in the process?
        answer: A random integer is generated and assigned to cRandomInt to create
          unique identifiers for temporary subsets during the process.
  - context: The process validates the parameters to ensure a dimension is
      specified. If no dimension is specified (pDim is empty), an error message
      is logged, and the process either quits or breaks based on the strict
      error handling setting.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why is parameter validation important in this process?
        answer: Parameter validation is essential to ensure that a valid dimension or
          list of dimensions is specified for deletion. Without a valid pDim,
          the process cannot proceed and must halt.
      - question: What occurs if the pDim parameter is empty?
        answer: If the pDim parameter is empty, an error message is logged, indicating
          that no dimension was specified. The process then either quits or
          breaks, depending on the strict error handling setting.
      - question: How is error handling managed in the process?
        answer: Error handling is managed by logging appropriate error messages and
          controlling the process flow either by quitting or breaking based on
          the strict error handling setting.
  - context: Dimensions are deleted by looping through the specified dimensions in
      pDim. If a dimension exists and is not used in a cube, it is destroyed.
      Otherwise, an error message is logged, and the dimension is not deleted.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How are dimensions deleted if they exist and are not used?
        answer: Dimensions that exist and are not used in any cubes are deleted by
          invoking the DimensionDestroy function.
      - question: What happens if a dimension is used in a cube?
        answer: If a dimension is used in a cube, it is not deleted, and an error
          message is logged specifying the cube(s) in which the dimension is
          used.
      - question: What function is used to delete an existing dimension?
        answer: The function used to delete an existing dimension is DimensionDestroy.
  - context: The process incorporates the use of a temporary subset created with a
      specified wildcard to handle multiple dimensions dynamically. LogOutput is
      used to record process actions and any errors encountered during
      execution.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle multiple dimensions specified by a
          wildcard?
        answer: The process creates a temporary subset using the specified wildcard to
          loop through and delete multiple dimensions dynamically.
      - question: What role does LogOutput play in the process?
        answer: LogOutput is utilized to record process actions, including information
          and error messages, facilitating monitoring and debugging of the
          process.
      - question: How are temporary subsets managed within the process?
        answer: Temporary subsets are created using specific MDX queries with a wildcard
          for dimension matching, and they are utilized to delete dimensions
          dynamically without modifying existing subsets.
document_outline: The document provides a detailed explanation of an IBM Turbo
  Integrator process designed to delete dimensions or lists of dimensions based
  on wildcard name matches. It includes the purpose, parameter validations,
  error handling, dimension deletion logic, and the use of temporary subsets.
