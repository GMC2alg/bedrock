  - context: "This process will copy security from one user to another. Target
      client(s) will be created if it doesn't exist. Use case: Intended for
      production. When a company hires new employees their profile can be set up
      by cloning an existing employee. Note: A valid source client (pSrcClient)
      is mandatory otherwise the process will abort. Also, a valid target
      client(s) (pTgtClient) must be specified, otherwise the process will
      abort."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary function of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The primary function is to copy security from one user to another and
          create target clients if they do not exist.
      - question: When is this process intended to be used?
        answer: It is intended for use in production, particularly when a company hires
          new employees and their profiles are set up by cloning an existing
          employee.
      - question: Is a source client mandatory for this process?
        answer: Yes, a valid source client (pSrcClient) is mandatory, otherwise the
          process will abort.
  - context: Multiple target clients can be specified separated by a delimiter. If
      target client doesn't already exist then Bedrock.Security.Client.Create
      will be called. The process has 2 modes REPLACE (default) clears any
      existing group memberships. ADD only adds new ones.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How can multiple target clients be specified?
        answer: Multiple target clients can be specified separated by a delimiter.
      - question: What happens if a target client does not exist?
        answer: If a target client does not exist, the process calls
          Bedrock.Security.Client.Create to create it.
      - question: What are the two modes of this process and what do they do?
        answer: "The process has two modes: REPLACE, which clears any existing group
          memberships, and ADD, which only adds new ones."
  - context: The process validates parameters such as pDelim, pMode, pSrcClient, and
      pTgtClient. It logs errors and aborts if essential parameters are missing
      or invalid.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What parameters does the process validate?
        answer: The process validates parameters like pDelim, pMode, pSrcClient, and
          pTgtClient.
      - question: What happens if essential parameters are missing or invalid?
        answer: The process logs errors and either aborts or handles the error depending
          on the parameter pStrictErrorHandling.
      - question: What is the role of pStrictErrorHandling?
        answer: If pStrictErrorHandling is set to 1, the process will terminate on
          errors; otherwise, it will break and continue.
  - context: Upon completion, the process logs the final action taken and returns a
      process return code indicating success or failure.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process indicate completion?
        answer: It logs the final action and returns a process return code indicating
          success or failure.
      - question: What information is logged upon process completion?
        answer: The process logs which client was cloned to which target by what mode,
          along with error details if any.
      - question: What does a return code of 1 indicate?
        answer: A return code of 1 indicates the process completed successfully.
  - context: The source code outlines a structured process flow involving parameter
      validation, client creation, group membership updating, and error
      handling.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the general flow of the process?
        answer: The process includes parameter validation, client creation, updating
          group memberships, and handling errors.
      - question: How are errors handled during the process?
        answer: Errors are logged with specific messages, and the process can either
          quit or continue based on pStrictErrorHandling.
      - question: Does the process update security group memberships?
        answer: Yes, the process updates security group memberships for specified target
          clients based on the mode (ADD or REPLACE).
document_outline: This document provides an overview of an IBM Turbo Integrator
  process designed to copy security data from one user to another, ensuring
  target clients are created if they do not exist.
