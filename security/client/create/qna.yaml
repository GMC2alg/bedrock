  - context: This process will create clients, assign a password and max ports.
      Intended for production, it allows creating clients for multiple new hires
      simultaneously. A client (pClient) is mandatory otherwise the process will
      abort. Multiple clients can be specified separated by a delimiter. If a
      client already exists, the process will reset the password and max ports
      instead of re-creating it. Each client will have to be assigned to a group
      afterwards.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary function of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The primary function of this process is to create clients, assign a
          password, and set the maximum number of ports for each client,
          particularly for multiple new hires.
      - question: What happens if a client already exists when the process runs?
        answer: If a client already exists, the process will not attempt to re-create
          it. Instead, it will reset the client's password and max ports.
      - question: Is it possible to create multiple clients in one process run, and how?
        answer: Yes, it is possible to create multiple clients in one process run by
          specifying them separated by a delimiter.
  - context: If no clients have been specified, the process will terminate. Clients
      must be specified in the pClient parameter, with multiple clients
      separated by a delimiter. A blank delimiter will default to '&'. Error
      handling is in place, which can either terminate (ProcessQuit) or break
      (ProcessBreak) the process based on the error handling setting
      (pStrictErrorHandling).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What will happen if no clients are specified for the process?
        answer: If no clients are specified, the process will terminate, as a client
          (pClient) parameter is mandatory.
      - question: What is the default delimiter used if none is specified for separating
          multiple clients?
        answer: If no delimiter is specified, the process will default to using '&' as
          the delimiter.
      - question: How does the process handle errors?
        answer: The process handles errors by either terminating the process with
          ProcessQuit or breaking it with ProcessBreak, based on the Strict
          Error Handling setting (pStrictErrorHandling).
document_outline: A Turbo Integrator process designed for creating and managing
  client accounts, including password and port assignment, specifically aimed at
  managing new hires effectively and ensuring they are set up in the production
  environment.
