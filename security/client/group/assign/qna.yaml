  - context: "This process will assign Client and Group Security. Use case: Intended
      for production. After adding new user(s) using
      '}bedrock.security.client.create' they must be assigned to groups.
      Naturally, valid client (pClient) is mandatory otherwise the process can't
      make assignments. This process can either add or remove clients to groups
      based on pAddOrRemove. It can work on a single client or multiple clients
      separated by a delimiter and a single group or multiple groups separated
      by a delimiter."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The main purpose of the Turbo Integrator process is to assign clients to
          groups for security purposes, after new users are added using
          '}bedrock.security.client.create'.
      - question: In what cases can this process be used?
        answer: This process can be used to add or remove a single client to/from a
          single group, many clients to/from a single group, a single client
          to/from many groups, or many clients to/from many groups.
      - question: What is required for this process to make assignments?
        answer: A valid client (pClient) is mandatory for the process to make
          assignments.
  - context: The caller can choose whether or not to refresh security at the end.
      Default is yes. The process is flexible enough to handle a single client
      with multiple groups or multiple clients with a single group by using
      delimiters. It also includes parameters to specify if security should be
      refreshed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the default setting for security refresh in this process?
        answer: The default setting for security refresh is set to 'yes'.
      - question: How does the process handle multiple clients or groups?
        answer: The process can handle multiple clients or groups by accepting them
          separated by a delimiter.
      - question: Can the caller control security refresh, and how?
        answer: Yes, the caller can choose whether or not to refresh security at the end
          of the process by specifying a parameter.
