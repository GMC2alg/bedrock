- context: This IBM Turbo Integrator process is designed to delete clients. The use
    case includes cleaning up users after the system goes live in both development
    and production environments, as well as removing former employees from the system
    upon termination. Note that specifying a valid client or multiple clients is mandatory;
    otherwise, the process will abort. Multiple clients can be specified using a delimiter.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The Turbo Integrator process is designed to delete clients, clean up users
      post-go live, and remove former employees upon termination.
  - question: Is it mandatory to specify valid clients in the process?
    answer: Yes, specifying a valid client or multiple clients is mandatory; otherwise,
      the process will abort.
  - question: How can multiple clients be specified in the process?
    answer: Multiple clients can be specified using a delimiter.
- context: This process will abort if no clients are specified. It logs an error message,
    and if strict error handling is enabled, it will terminate the process. The process
    also validates parameters, converts a blank delimiter to a default one, and checks
    for the existence of necessary attributes in the given dimensions.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if no clients are specified in the process?
    answer: If no clients are specified, the process will log an error message and
      may abort, especially if strict error handling is enabled.
  - question: What does the process do if a blank delimiter is specified?
    answer: The process converts a blank delimiter to a default one.
  - question: Does the process check for the existence of necessary attributes?
    answer: Yes, the process validates the parameters and checks for the existence
      of necessary attributes in the given dimensions.
- context: During the execution, the process deletes specified clients unless they
    are 'Admin' or the currently logged-in TM1 user. For wildcard searches, the process
    creates or re-uses a subset to handle deletion requests with wildcards, and logs
    appropriate messages if an Admin or the current user is attempted to be deleted.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Does the process attempt to delete the 'Admin' or the current user?
    answer: No, the process does not delete 'Admin' or the currently logged-in TM1
      user, and logs a warning instead.
  - question: How does the process handle wildcard searches for client deletion?
    answer: The process creates or re-uses a subset for handling deletion requests
      that include wildcards.
  - question: What kind of messages does the process log if it attempts to delete
      an Admin or the current user?
    answer: The process logs a warning message if an Admin or the current user is
      attempted to be deleted.
- context: Error handling in the process includes logging errors, returning a process
    return code, and optionally quitting the process if strict error handling is enabled.
    The process sorts the client dimension after successful execution and logs a success
    message if no errors occurred.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if errors are encountered during the process execution?
    answer: The process logs errors, returns a process error code, and may quit if
      strict error handling is enabled.
  - question: What happens after the successful execution of the process?
    answer: After successful execution, the process sorts the client dimension and
      logs a success message.
  - question: Is there any logging of success or error messages?
    answer: Yes, the process logs both success and error messages depending on the
      outcome of the execution.
- context: The Turbo Integrator process is executed within a specific procedural structure
    containing prolog, metadata, data, and epilog sections. Each section serves a
    distinct purpose ranging from defining variables and constants to executing the
    main logic and finalizing the error handling.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the main sections of the Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The main sections include the prolog, metadata, data, and epilog, each
      serving specific purposes such as defining variables and executing logic.
  - question: What is the purpose of the prolog section in the process?
    answer: The prolog section is used to define variables, constants, and perform
      initial setup and validation.
  - question: What is handled in the epilog section of the process?
    answer: The epilog section handles final error message logging, process return
      codes, and potentially quitting the process if errors occurred.
