- context: 'This process will create client groups. Use case: Intended for development
    or production. 1/ Create initial security groups. 2/ Add security groups as business
    needs change. Note: Naturally, a group (pGroup) is mandatory otherwise the process
    will abort. Multiple groups can be specified separated by a delimiter. If group
    already exists then the process will skip that group.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the primary purpose of this process?
    answer: The primary purpose of this process is to create client groups, both for
      development and production use cases.
  - question: What happens if no group is specified?
    answer: If no group (pGroup) is specified, the process will abort, as specifying
      a group is mandatory.
  - question: Can multiple groups be added at once?
    answer: Yes, multiple groups can be specified and added at once by separating
      them with a delimiter.
- context: Global Variables are used throughout the process. StringGlobalVariable('sProcessReturnCode');
    NumericGlobalVariable('nProcessReturnCode'); nProcessReturnCode= 0; Constants
    in the code include cThisProcName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt, cUserName, cMsgErrorLevel,
    cMsgErrorContent, and cLogInfo.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are some of the global variables used in the process?
    answer: Some of the global variables used include 'sProcessReturnCode' and 'nProcessReturnCode'.
  - question: What does the variable nProcessReturnCode represent?
    answer: The variable nProcessReturnCode is a numeric global variable initialized
      to 0 and used to indicate the number of errors or the process state.
  - question: What kind of constants are defined in the process?
    answer: The constants defined include cThisProcName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt, cUserName,
      cMsgErrorLevel, cMsgErrorContent, and cLogInfo.
- context: The process checks for errors before proceeding. If nErrors <> 0, it will
    either perform ProcessQuit or ProcessBreak based on the parameter pStrictErrorHandling.
    LogOutput messages are used to log information or errors depending on the situation.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if errors are found before the process continues?
    answer: If errors are found (nErrors <> 0), the process will either quit or break,
      depending on the pStrictErrorHandling parameter.
  - question: How is logging used in the process?
    answer: LogOutput is used to log information or error messages depending on the
      success or failure of process steps.
  - question: What is the role of pStrictErrorHandling?
    answer: The pStrictErrorHandling parameter determines if the process should quit
      immediately on encountering an error.
- context: The code handles group creation by splitting groups with a specified delimiter
    and checking if they exist before adding. If a group already exists, the process
    skips adding that group.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How are groups processed in the code?
    answer: Groups are processed by splitting them with a specified delimiter, and
      each is checked for existence before adding.
  - question: What occurs if a group already exists when processing?
    answer: If a group already exists, the process skips adding that group.
  - question: Is there a delimiter used in processing groups?
    answer: Yes, groups are separated and processed using a specified delimiter.
- context: The process has error and success messaging at the end. If there are errors,
    a detailed message is logged, and the process might quit if pStrictErrorHandling
    is enabled. Otherwise, it logs a successful creation of groups.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if the process ends with errors?
    answer: If the process ends with errors, a detailed error message is logged, and
      the process might quit depending on pStrictErrorHandling.
  - question: How is success indicated in the process?
    answer: Success is indicated by logging a message stating that the process successfully
      created the groups.
  - question: What role does pStrictErrorHandling play in the final error message
      handling?
    answer: pStrictErrorHandling determines if the process should quit immediately
      when errors are detected at the end of the process.
document_outline: The document describes the steps for creating client groups using
  a Turbo Integrator process, handling errors, and managing group existence checks.
