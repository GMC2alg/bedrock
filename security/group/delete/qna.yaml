  - context: "This process will delete client groups. Intended for development or
      production. Clean up security groups after go live. Delete obsolete
      security groups as business needs change. A group (pGroup) is mandatory
      otherwise the process will abort: Multiple groups can be specified
      separated by a delimiter. If group does not exist then it will be skipped.
      If multiple groups are specified and some don't exist and some do, then
      the ones that do exist will still be deleted."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of the process described?
        answer: The process is designed to delete client groups, and it can be used for
          both development and production environments to clean up or delete
          obsolete security groups.
      - question: Is it necessary to specify a group (pGroup) for the process to run?
        answer: Yes, specifying a group (pGroup) is mandatory; otherwise, the process
          will abort.
      - question: What happens if a specified group does not exist?
        answer: If a specified group does not exist, it will be skipped, and the process
          will continue to delete any existing groups specified.
  - context: This Turbo Integrator process includes validation of parameters and
      checks for errors before continuing. If no groups are specified, an error
      is logged and the process is terminated or halted based on strict error
      handling settings. Built-in groups such as ADMIN and DataAdmin cannot be
      deleted.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if no groups are specified in the parameters?
        answer: If no groups are specified, an error is logged, and the process is
          either terminated or halted depending on the strict error handling
          settings.
      - question: Can built-in groups like ADMIN and DataAdmin be deleted?
        answer: No, built-in groups such as ADMIN, SecurityAdmin, DataAdmin, and
          OperationsAdmin cannot be deleted by the process.
      - question: How does the process handle errors before proceeding?
        answer: The process checks for errors before continuing; it logs an error
          message and will halt or terminate if errors are detected and strict
          error handling is enabled.
