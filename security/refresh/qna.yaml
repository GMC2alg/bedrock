  - context: "This process refreshes TM1 security. Use case: Intended for
      development or production. 1/ Refresh security after new clients or
      security groups are added. 2/ If security cubes have rules and they had to
      be changed. Note: This can be a time consuming process and may need to be
      run overnight."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary purpose of the Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The primary purpose of the Turbo Integrator process is to refresh TM1
          security.
      - question: In which scenarios should the TM1 security refresh process be used?
        answer: The TM1 security refresh process should be used in scenarios where new
          clients or security groups are added, or when security cubes have
          rules that needed to be changed.
      - question: Is the TM1 security refresh process quick to run?
        answer: No, the TM1 security refresh process can be time-consuming and may need
          to be run overnight.
  - context: "##Global Variables StringGlobalVariable('sProcessReturnCode');
      NumericGlobalVariable('nProcessReturnCode'); nProcessReturnCode= 0;"
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is 'sProcessReturnCode'?
        answer: "'sProcessReturnCode' is defined as a global string variable in the
          process."
      - question: What does 'nProcessReturnCode' represent?
        answer: "'nProcessReturnCode' is a numeric global variable initialized to 0,
          used to track the process return code."
      - question: Why is 'nProcessReturnCode' initialized to 0?
        answer: "'nProcessReturnCode' is initialized to 0 to indicate that there are no
          errors at the start of the process."
  - context: "### End Prolog ### #Section Metadaten #****Begin: Generated
      Statements*** #****End: Generated Statements****"
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of the Prolog section in the code?
        answer: The Prolog section in the code contains initial setup instructions and
          variable declarations necessary for the process execution.
      - question: What follows after the Prolog section in the Turbo Integrator script?
        answer: After the Prolog section, the code moves to the Metadaten section.
      - question: Are there any generated statements in the Metadaten section?
        answer: No, there are no generated statements in the Metadaten section as
          indicated by the placeholders.
  - context: "## LogOutput parameters IF( pLogoutput = 1 ); LogOutput('INFO',
      Expand( cLogInfo ) ); ENDIF;"
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of the LogOutput statement in the code?
        answer: The LogOutput statement is used to log information if the 'pLogoutput'
          parameter is set to 1, which enables logging.
      - question: What condition must be met for LogOutput to execute?
        answer: For LogOutput to execute, 'pLogoutput' must be equal to 1.
      - question: What information is logged when the condition for LogOutput is met?
        answer: When the condition is met, a message containing the current process's
          name and parameters is logged.
  - context: "### Return code & final error message handling If( nErrors > 0 );
      sMessage = 'the process incurred at least 1 error. Please see above lines
      in this file for more details.'; nProcessReturnCode = 0;"
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process do when an error is detected?
        answer: When an error is detected, it sets a message indicating the presence of
          errors and assigns 0 to 'nProcessReturnCode'.
      - question: What value is assigned to 'nProcessReturnCode' when no errors are
          found?
        answer: When no errors are found, 'nProcessReturnCode' is set to 1.
      - question: Where are detailed error logs advised to be checked?
        answer: Detailed error logs are advised to be checked in the 'tm1server.log'
          file.
document_outline: The document outlines the implementation and use of a Turbo
  Integrator process designed to refresh TM1 security in both development and
  production environments.
