- context: This IBM Turbo Integrator process creates a cell security cube for a specified
    cube and a specified list of dimensions using the TI function _CellSecurityCubeCreate_.
    The benefit of this process is that it eliminates the need to write a custom process
    each time a cell security cube is needed. A valid cube (pCube) is mandatory; otherwise,
    the process will abort. If cell security is already set up, the TI process will
    also abort. The pDim parameter must map _ALL_ the dimensions in order in the cube
    with a 0 or 1. This process is intended for development purposes and is used for
    setting up cell security cubes.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does this IBM Turbo Integrator process do?
    answer: This process creates a cell security cube for a specified cube and list
      of dimensions using the _CellSecurityCubeCreate_ function, avoiding the need
      for custom processes.
  - question: What is required for the process to not abort?
    answer: A valid cube (pCube) must be specified; otherwise, the process will abort.
  - question: What is the purpose of the pDim parameter?
    answer: The pDim parameter must map _ALL_ the dimensions in order in the cube
      with a 0 or 1.
- context: Use of the IBM Turbo Integrator process helps in setting up cell security
    cubes without needing a custom process every time. This action is meant for development
    purposes, emphasizing that a valid cube parameter is crucial. The TI function
    _CellSecurityCubeCreate_ is central to this process, aiming to simplify the development
    process by automating cell security cube creation.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main function used in this TI process?
    answer: The main function used is _CellSecurityCubeCreate_.
  - question: For what purpose is this TI process intended?
    answer: The process is intended for development purposes, particularly in setting
      up cell security cubes.
  - question: What happens if cell security is already set up?
    answer: If cell security is already set up, the TI process will abort.
