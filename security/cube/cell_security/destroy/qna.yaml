  - context: "This process will destroy the cell security cube(s) for the specified
      cube(s). Use case: Intended for development. Remove cell level security
      for one or more cubes. Naturally, a valid cube (pCube) is mandatory
      otherwise the process will abort. If the cube does not have cell security
      set up, it will skip that cube but log an error. Multiple cubes can be
      specified separated by the pDelim or by using wildcards (*)."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of the Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The Turbo Integrator process is designed to destroy the cell security
          cubes for specified cubes, primarily for development purposes.
      - question: What happens if a cube without cell security is specified?
        answer: If a cube without cell security is specified, the process will skip that
          cube but log an error.
      - question: How can multiple cubes be specified in the process?
        answer: Multiple cubes can be specified by separating them with the delimiter
          pDelim or by using wildcards (*).
  - context: The process requires a valid cube (pCube); otherwise, it aborts. It
      logs an error if no cell security is found for a cube. The process
      supports multiple cube entries, separated by a delimiter (pDelim) or using
      wildcards.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Is a valid cube mandatory for the process?
        answer: Yes, a valid cube (pCube) is mandatory for the process, or it will
          abort.
      - question: How does the process manage errors?
        answer: The process logs an error if a cube does not have cell security set up
          or if no cubes are specified.
      - question: What are the methods to specify multiple cubes in the process?
        answer: Multiple cubes can be specified by separating them with a delimiter
          (pDelim) or by using wildcards (*).
