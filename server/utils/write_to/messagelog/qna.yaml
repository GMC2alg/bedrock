- context: This process will write a Message into the TM1 server Message Log. It includes
    steps for initialization, execution, and error handling.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does this Turbo Integrator process do?
    answer: This process writes a message into the TM1 server Message Log.
  - question: What are the main steps defined in this process?
    answer: The main steps are initialization, execution, and error handling.
  - question: What is the purpose of error handling in this process?
    answer: The error handling ensures that any issues are logged and handled appropriately,
      either by quitting the process or breaking it, depending on the strict error
      handling setting.
- context: Global and numeric variables are used to capture process details like return
    codes. Logging is utilized to document the process execution and errors.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How are process details captured in this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: Process details are captured using global and numeric variables like 'sProcessReturnCode'
      and 'nProcessReturnCode'.
  - question: What role does logging play in this process?
    answer: Logging is used to document the process execution details and any errors
      encountered.
  - question: What variables store the process return codes?
    answer: The variables 'sProcessReturnCode' and 'nProcessReturnCode' store the
      process return codes.
- context: Parameters like 'pLogoutput' and 'pStrictErrorHandling' control logging
    behavior and error handling rigor. Incorrect parameter types trigger error logging.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process respond to incorrect parameter types?
    answer: Incorrect parameter types trigger error logging, and the process may either
      quit or break depending on error handling settings.
  - question: What does the 'pLogoutput' parameter control?
    answer: The 'pLogoutput' parameter controls whether the process writes additional
      information logs.
  - question: What happens if 'pStrictErrorHandling' is set to 1?
    answer: If 'pStrictErrorHandling' is set to 1, the process will quit immediately
      upon encountering errors.
- context: The process uses conditional statements to validate input parameters and
    log errors. Message templates are predefined for error and process information
    logging.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are message templates used for in this process?
    answer: Message templates are used for predefined formatting of error and informational
      log messages.
  - question: What purpose do conditional statements serve in this process?
    answer: Conditional statements are used to validate input parameters and control
      error logging.
  - question: How are errors logged in this process?
    answer: Errors are logged using message templates and might include process and
      user details in the error message.
- context: The final section of the process checks for any errors that occurred, logs
    a final message, and sets the return code accordingly. It ensures the process
    is completed with or without errors.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process handle the final error check?
    answer: The final error check determines if any errors occurred, logs a summary
      message, and sets a return code.
  - question: What dictates the process return code?
    answer: The process return code is set based on whether the process completes
      successfully or with errors.
  - question: What is logged if the process completes with errors?
    answer: If the process completes with errors, a message is logged indicating at
      least one error occurred and advising to check the TM1 server log.

  TM1 server, including clear steps for initialization, execution, and error handling.
