seed_examples:
- context: Develop an IBM Turbo Integrator process that saves all data to disk. This
    process should be used in a production environment. It can be executed multiple
    times a day during the planning cycle. Note that depending on the time elapsed
    since the last data save, this operation can take several seconds or even minutes.
    Therefore, it should ideally be scheduled during a lunch break.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the IBM Turbo Integrator process described?
    answer: The purpose of the IBM Turbo Integrator process is to save all data to
      disk in a production environment.
  - question: How often can the IBM Turbo Integrator process be executed?
    answer: The process can be executed multiple times a day during the planning cycle.
  - question: When is the ideal time to schedule the IBM Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The ideal time to schedule the process is during a lunch break to minimize
      impact on operations.
- context: The process will Save All Data to disk. It is intended for production and
    can be run multiple times a day during the planning cycle. Depending on how long
    since the last data save, this could take several seconds if not minutes, so it
    should ideally be scheduled over a lunch break.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main function of this Turbo Integrator code?
    answer: The main function of this Turbo Integrator code is to save all data to
      disk.
  - question: For which environment is the Turbo Integrator process intended?
    answer: The Turbo Integrator process is intended for a production environment.
  - question: Why should the Turbo Integrator process be scheduled during a lunch
      break?
    answer: It should be scheduled during a lunch break because depending on the time
      since the last data save, it may take several seconds or minutes, minimizing
      disruption.
document_outline: Instructions for creating an IBM Turbo Integrator process to persistently
  save all data to disk, suitable for use in production settings and optimized for
  scheduling around operational downtimes.
