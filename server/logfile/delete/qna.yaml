seed_examples:
- context: This process will delete log files, csv files, and debug files which are
    'x' days old. It is intended for production as a process to clean up old files
    to save space on the hard disk. Note that the target directory (pTgtDir) will
    default to the setting in the TM1 configuration file if left blank.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The purpose of this Turbo Integrator process is to delete log files, csv
      files, and debug files that are 'x' days old, freeing up space on the hard disk.
  - question: What will happen if the target directory (pTgtDir) is left blank?
    answer: If the target directory (pTgtDir) is left blank, it will default to the
      setting specified in the TM1 configuration file.
  - question: Is this process meant for a particular environment?
    answer: Yes, this process is intended for production environments.
- context: The process checks the operating system to determine the appropriate commands
    to execute. It differentiates between Windows and Linux/Unix systems and adjusts
    file deletion commands accordingly using either batch scripts for Windows or shell
    scripts for Linux.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does this process handle operating system differences?
    answer: The process checks if the operating system is Windows or Linux and executes
      the corresponding batch or shell script for file deletion.
  - question: Which file extension is used for command scripts in Windows in this
      process?
    answer: In Windows, the process uses '.bat' as the file extension for command
      scripts.
  - question: What type of script does the process use for Linux systems?
    answer: For Linux systems, the process uses a shell script with the '.sh' extension.
- context: The process logs its activities and checks for errors before proceeding.
    If errors are detected and strict error handling is enabled, it will terminate;
    otherwise, it will attempt to continue or break as specified.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if errors are encountered and strict error handling is
      enabled?
    answer: If errors are encountered and strict error handling is enabled, the process
      will terminate immediately.
  - question: Does the process log its actions?
    answer: Yes, the process logs its actions and parameters.
  - question: What happens if strict error handling is not enabled and an error occurs?
    answer: If strict error handling is not enabled, the process will either continue
      or break the execution based on its configuration.
- context: The process includes a mechanism to validate input parameters, such as
    trimming whitespace from the target directory parameter and checking if the directory
    exists. It also converts numerical parameters like days into strings.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process validate the target directory parameter?
    answer: The process trims any whitespace from the target directory and checks
      if the directory exists.
  - question: What conversion does the process perform on day parameters?
    answer: Day parameters are converted from numbers to strings using the 'NumberToString'
      function.
  - question: What is checked before the process continues its execution?
    answer: The process checks if any errors were detected before continuing.
- context: The process finally executes the constructed command file for the applicable
    OS (either '.bat' for Windows or '.sh' for Linux), and it ensures temporary script
    files are removed after execution.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the process execute towards the end?
    answer: Towards the end, the process executes the constructed command file depending
      on the operating system, and deletes the temporary script files afterward.
  - question: How does the process ensure cleanliness after script execution?
    answer: The process removes temporary script files to ensure cleanliness after
      execution.
  - question: What ensures that the correct script is executed based on the OS?
    answer: The process dynamically generates and executes either a '.bat' or '.sh'
      script based on determining the operating system.
document_outline: This document outlines the Turbo Integrator process designed to
  clear log, csv, and debug files older than a specified number of days in production
  environments, ensuring efficient disk space management.
