- context: This process will Delete Persistent feeders. Intended for development or
    production. Persistent feeders should be turned off in the config file. There
    is a need to reprocess feeders. Reprocessing feeders could take a long time and
    it may be better to run this overnight.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process is to delete persistent
      feeders.
  - question: In which environments is this process intended to be used?
    answer: This process is intended for use in both development and production environments.
  - question: What should be done before running the feeder deletion process?
    answer: Before running the feeder deletion process, persistent feeders should
      be turned off in the config file.
- context: The process log output parameters include a logging mechanism that captures
    the process runtime information. The process returns codes and handles error messages
    appropriately, allowing for successful execution or indicating errors.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the log output parameter do in this process?
    answer: The log output parameter captures the process runtime information through
      a logging mechanism.
  - question: How does the process handle error messages?
    answer: The process handles error messages by returning codes and indicating errors
      in the log output.
  - question: What happens when errors occur during the process execution?
    answer: When errors occur, the process outputs an error message in the log and
      may terminate based on strict error handling settings.
- context: The Turbo Integrator process uses several global and numeric variables
    to manage state and process conditions. Variables like sProcessReturnCode and
    nProcessReturnCode are used to track the process status.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the role of global variables in this process?
    answer: Global variables manage process states and conditions, such as tracking
      the process's status using sProcessReturnCode and nProcessReturnCode.
  - question: Which variable indicates the success or failure of the process?
    answer: The nProcessReturnCode variable indicates the success or failure of the
      process.
  - question: How is the process return code defined?
    answer: The process return code is defined by checking error conditions and updating
      nProcessReturnCode accordingly.
- context: The epilog section of the Turbo Integrator process includes final error
    handling and logging. It ensures that messages about the completion state of the
    process are appropriately dealt with.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main purpose of the epilog section in this process?
    answer: The main purpose of the epilog section is to handle final error logging
      and ensure completion messages are accurately processed.
  - question: What does the process record if at least one error occurs?
    answer: If at least one error occurs, the process logs an error message and the
      completion state indicating issues were encountered.
  - question: How are errors reported in the epilog section?
    answer: Errors are reported through log output, which contains detailed completion
      messages and error descriptions.
- context: There is a note that reprocessing feeders can take a long time, so it might
    be advisable to run this process overnight to minimize impact on daily operations.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Why might it be advisable to run this process overnight?
    answer: It might be advisable to run the process overnight due to the potential
      long duration needed for reprocessing feeders.
  - question: What impact might reprocessing feeders have on daily operations?
    answer: Reprocessing feeders could impact daily operations due to the lengthy
      processing time, hence the recommendation to run overnight.
  - question: What is suggested to minimize the impact of feeder reprocessing?
    answer: To minimize impact, it is suggested to run the feeding reprocessing process
      overnight.
document_outline: This document provides an overview of the Turbo Integrator process
  designed for deleting persistent feeders, intended for development or production
  environments, with an emphasis on proper configuration and error handling.
