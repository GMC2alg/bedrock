- context: 'The process unencrypts all files existing in a directory, using the tm1crypt
    utility. Use case: To encrypt/unencrypt multiple files in a directory. Calls sub-processes.
    Note: Generated commands will only work when the TM1 instance is encrypted.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The main purpose of this Turbo Integrator process is to unencrypt all
      files existing in a directory using the tm1crypt utility.
  - question: What is the use case for this Turbo Integrator process?
    answer: The use case for this process is to encrypt or unencrypt multiple files
      in a directory, calling sub-processes as necessary.
  - question: Under what condition will the generated commands work?
    answer: The generated commands will only work when the TM1 instance is encrypted.
- context: Global variables and constants are used in this Turbo Integrator process.
    StringGlobalVariable and NumericGlobalVariable are defined for handling process
    return codes. Various constants are defined, such as cThisProcName for process
    name and cTimeStamp for timestamps.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are StringGlobalVariable and NumericGlobalVariable used for in
      this process?
    answer: StringGlobalVariable and NumericGlobalVariable are used for handling process
      return codes in this Turbo Integrator process.
  - question: Name a constant defined in this process and its purpose.
    answer: The constant cThisProcName is defined to store the name of the process,
      aiding in logging and reporting.
  - question: How is a timestamp utilized in this process?
    answer: A timestamp, defined as cTimeStamp, is used for logging purposes, capturing
      the exact time actions are performed.
- context: Parameters are validated within the process. Checks include verifying the
    operating system, validating the source directory, and ensuring specified files
    exist for configuration and tm1crypt usage. Errors are logged, and corrective
    actions like quitting or breaking the process are defined.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What parameters are validated in the process?
    answer: Parameters such as the operating system, source directory, and existence
      of specified files for configuration and tm1crypt are validated.
  - question: How are errors handled during parameter validation?
    answer: Errors are logged, and corrective actions like quitting or breaking the
      process are defined if validation fails.
  - question: What happens if the source directory is not valid?
    answer: If the source directory is not valid, an error is logged, and the process
      may be quit or broken, depending on error handling settings.
- context: The process performs a search for files in the specified source path using
    a wildcard pattern. It logs the processing of each file and handles errors, incrementing
    error counts as necessary. The process involves the execution of a sub-process
    for each file.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process handle files in the source directory?
    answer: The process uses a wildcard search to find files and logs the processing
      of each file while handling errors by incrementing error counts.
  - question: What action is performed for each file found in the directory?
    answer: A sub-process is executed for each file found in the directory, handling
      encryption or decryption based on parameters.
  - question: What happens when an error occurs during the processing of a file?
    answer: When an error occurs, the error count is incremented, a log entry is made,
      and the process may either continue with the next file or handle the error based
      on defined conditions.
- context: The final section deals with handling the overall result of the process.
    If errors occurred, appropriate messages are logged, and return codes are set
    to indicate the process's success or failure. Log outputs are used to provide
    a summary of actions taken.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How are the final results of the process handled?
    answer: The final results are handled by logging messages based on whether errors
      occurred and setting return codes to indicate success or failure.
  - question: What happens if no errors are found during the process?
    answer: If no errors are found, a success message is logged, and the appropriate
      return code is set to reflect successful process execution.
  - question: How does the process communicate the occurrence of errors?
    answer: The process uses log outputs to communicate errors, marking the log with
      details of what failed and setting return codes accordingly.
