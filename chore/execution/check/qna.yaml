  - context: This TI was created to overcome the limited scheduling options in
      chores. In order to use this TI it has to be the 1st TI in the chore. As
      an example, if you need to run a chore every Monday & Wednesday you would
      schedule it to run EVERY day but set the pWeekdays parameter to Mon & Wed.
      The chore would then kick off every day but this TI will perform a
      ProcessExitByChoreQuit function on all days NOT mentioned in pWeekdays.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The purpose of this Turbo Integrator process is to overcome the limited
          scheduling options in chores by allowing a chore to be scheduled every
          day and only execute on specified weekdays using the pWeekdays
          parameter.
      - question: How should this Turbo Integrator be positioned in the chore?
        answer: This Turbo Integrator process should be the first process in the chore
          to ensure it can control whether or not the chore should continue
          based on the specified days.
      - question: What function does this TI perform on days not specified in pWeekdays?
        answer: On days not specified in pWeekdays, this TI process executes a
          ProcessExitByChoreQuit function to terminate the chore.
  - context: "Use case: For productive systems. 1. A chore should run every 30
      minutes between 8am & 8pm on weekdays. Schedule chore for every 30 minutes
      and include this process 1st in chore with parameters
      pWeekDays=MON&TUE&WED&THU&FRI pStartTime=8 pEndTime=20. 2. A chore should
      run only on 1st calendar day of each month. Schedule chore for daily
      execution and include this process 1st in chore with parameters
      pMonthDays=1."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How can this TI process be used to schedule a chore only on weekdays
          between 8am and 8pm?
        answer: The TI process can be used by setting the parameters pWeekDays to
          MON&TUE&WED&THU&FRI and setting pStartTime to 8 and pEndTime to 20.
          The chore should be scheduled for every 30 minutes and this TI process
          should be included first in the chore.
      - question: What setup should be used to run a chore only on the first day of each
          month?
        answer: To run a chore only on the first day of each month, the chore should be
          scheduled for daily execution and this process should be included
          first in the chore with the parameter pMonthDays set to 1.
      - question: What are some use cases where this TI process is helpful for
          productive systems?
        answer: This TI process is helpful for productive systems when specific
          scheduling needs are required, such as running a chore at specific
          times during weekdays or on specific days of the month that regularly
          scheduled options cannot accommodate.
  - context: "Note: * This process will quit a chore if any time-bound,
      weekday-bound or date-bound conditions which define when the chore should
      NOT run are met. * Only the parameters(s) needed should be specified. *
      Only scheduled executions will be quit outside the parameters. The checks
      are bypassed if a chore is manually executed by a user. This is done by
      checking the TM1User function."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why will the process quit a chore?
        answer: The process will quit a chore if any of the defined time-bound,
          weekday-bound, or date-bound conditions indicating that the chore
          should not run are met.
      - question: Are manual executions affected by the checks of this TI process?
        answer: No, manual executions are not affected by the checks of this TI process.
          The checks are bypassed when a user manually executes a chore by
          evaluating the TM1User function.
      - question: What parameters should be specified for the TI to function correctly?
        answer: Only the parameters relevant to defining when the chore should not run
          need to be specified for the TI to function correctly, such as
          pMonthDays, pWeekDays, and time constraints like pStartTime and
          pEndTime.
document_outline: This document describes a Turbo Integrator process to enhance
  scheduling options in IBM TM1 chores. It provides guidance on setting up
  scheduling constraints such as specific weekdays, times, and days of the month
  for chore execution.
