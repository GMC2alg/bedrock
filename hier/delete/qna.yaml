  - context: The Turbo Integrator process is designed to delete a dimension or
      hierarchy (or a list thereof) in IBM Planning Analytics. It is intended
      primarily for development and prototyping purposes, helping to clean up
      unused dimensions/hierarchies after a project goes live. A valid dimension
      name (pDim) is mandatory; otherwise, the process will abort. If no
      hierarchy (pHier) is specified, the dimension will be deleted if it is not
      used by a regular cube. If a hierarchy is specified, it must be valid, or
      the process will abort.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary purpose of the Turbo Integrator process described?
        answer: The primary purpose of the Turbo Integrator process is for development
          and prototyping, specifically to delete unused dimensions or
          hierarchies after a project goes live.
      - question: What happens if an invalid dimension name is provided?
        answer: If an invalid dimension name is provided, the process will abort.
      - question: Under what condition will a dimension be deleted if no hierarchy is
          specified?
        answer: A dimension will be deleted if it is not used by a regular cube and no
          hierarchy is specified.
  - context: In this Turbo Integrator process, several global variables and
      constants are defined. These include sProcessReturnCode and
      nProcessReturnCode which are used to track errors during the process
      execution. The constants cThisProcName, cUserName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt,
      cTempSub, cMsgErrorLevel, cMsgErrorContent, cMsgInfoContent, and cLogInfo
      help manage the logging and process identification aspects, ensuring clear
      and informative logging throughout the process.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the role of the sProcessReturnCode variable?
        answer: The sProcessReturnCode variable is used to track errors during the
          execution of the process.
      - question: How is logging managed in this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: Logging is managed through predefined constants for error and
          information messages, ensuring clear logging of process events and
          errors.
      - question: What is cTimeStamp used for in the process?
        answer: cTimeStamp is used to create a unique identifier for each process run
          based on the current time.
  - context: The Turbo Integrator process includes validation to ensure appropriate
      parameters are provided. It checks if a valid dimension name is given and
      verifies the existence of specified hierarchies. If any validation check
      fails, the process logs the error and handles it according to the
      strictness of the error handling configuration. The process allows
      optional logging output to keep track of operations and issues.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What checks are performed during the parameter validation step?
        answer: The process checks for a valid dimension name and verifies the existence
          of specified hierarchies.
      - question: How does the process handle validation errors?
        answer: The process logs validation errors and handles them based on the
          strictness of the error handling configuration.
      - question: Is logging output optional in this process?
        answer: Yes, the process allows for optional logging output to track operations
          and issues.
