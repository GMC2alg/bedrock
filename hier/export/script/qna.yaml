  - context: "Develop an IBM Turbo Integrator process that exports a dimension with
      its hierarchies into a TurboIntegrator script. This should not include a
      CSV export but should create a hard-coded TurboIntegrator script that
      exports the dimension/hierarchy with complete rollup structures, attribute
      values, subsets, and metadata information, such as sort order, MDX
      hierarchy names, levels, and captions. The process should be useful for
      automatic script generation for migration purposes, without the need for
      any data source or other process parameters. This is particularly useful
      in environments without file system access and for manually defined
      dimensions. Consider the following parameters: pDim for filtering the
      dimensions/hierarchies to be exported, pEle for limiting the elements for
      export, pDimInfo for including metadata, pAttr and pAttrVal for attribute
      creation and values, and pSub for subset definitions."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary function of the IBM Turbo Integrator process
          described?
        answer: The primary function is to export a dimension with its hierarchies into
          a hard-coded TurboIntegrator script, including rollup structures,
          attribute values, subsets, and metadata information.
      - question: What parameters are considered in the IBM Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The parameters considered include pDim for filtering
          dimensions/hierarchies, pEle for limiting export elements, pDimInfo
          for metadata inclusion, pAttr and pAttrVal for attributes, and pSub
          for subset definitions.
      - question: Why is this process particularly useful in certain environments?
        answer: It is useful in environments without file system access and for manually
          defined dimensions, as it automates script generation without needing
          a data source or other process parameters.
  - context: "#Section Prolog This process exports a dimension hierarchies as
      TurboIntegrator script. This is rather than creating a CSV which can be
      read by a generic TurboIntegrator process this process creates a hardcoded
      TurboIntegrator process to create a dimension/hierarchy complete with
      rollup structure, attribute values, subsets and metadata information such
      as sort order, MDX hierarchy names and levels and captions."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What type of script does the TurboIntegrator process generate?
        answer: It generates a hardcoded TurboIntegrator script to create a
          dimension/hierarchy complete with rollup structure, attribute values,
          subsets, and metadata information.
      - question: Why doesn't the TurboIntegrator process create a CSV?
        answer: Instead of creating a CSV, it creates a hardcoded script for exporting
          the dimension, which is useful for automating script creation without
          a data source.
      - question: How does the TurboIntegrator process handle dimensions?
        answer: The process uses parameters like pDim for filtering
          dimensions/hierarchies and pEle for limiting the scope of elements
          included in the export.
document_outline: The document describes a TurboIntegrator process for exporting
  IBM TM1 dimensions, detailing the script's creation and the process'
  parameters for effective use in various environments.
