  - context: This process will Export all Dimension elements in a Hierarchy to a
      File. Export file maintains all data that can be used to completely
      reconstruct the dimension. A custom record delimiter (specified by a
      character or its ASCII code) can be used. The format of the file includes
      metadata, source dimension and hierarchy, dimension sort order, reserved
      lines for future development, a header for elements export, and elements
      export data.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this process?
        answer: The purpose of the process is to export all dimension elements in a
          hierarchy to a file that can be used to completely reconstruct the
          dimension.
      - question: How is the file format structured?
        answer: The file format includes metadata, source dimension and hierarchy,
          dimension sort order, reserved lines for future development, a header
          for elements export, and elements export data.
      - question: Can a custom delimiter be used, and how?
        answer: Yes, a custom delimiter can be used, specified by a character or its
          ASCII code.
  - context: The process should be used to back up the dimension before changes in
      the productive environment or to quickly replicate a large dimension. A
      valid dimension name, inclusion of a header, and legacy export format are
      mandatory; otherwise, the process will abort. A custom delimiter might be
      specified for the parameter pDelim as a single character or as a 3-digit
      ASCII code.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When should this process be used?
        answer: This process should be used to back up the dimension before changes in
          the productive environment or to quickly replicate a large dimension.
      - question: What are the mandatory parameters for this process to run?
        answer: A valid dimension name, inclusion of a header, and legacy export format
          are mandatory for the process to run.
      - question: How can a custom delimiter be specified?
        answer: A custom delimiter can be specified as a single character or as a
          3-digit ASCII code for the parameter pDelim.
document_outline: This document provides a description and instructions for an
  IBM Turbo Integrator process that exports all dimension elements in a
  hierarchy to a file, ensuring all data necessary for complete reconstruction
  is included. The process also details the use of custom delimiters and
  mandatory parameters for proper execution.
