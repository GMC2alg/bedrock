seed_examples:
  - context: "This process creates new elements in a dimension hierarchy. If the
      parameter pEle is supplied with a delimited list of elements, multiple
      elements will be created. A valid dimension name (pDim) and element list
      are mandatory, otherwise the process will abort. Caution: When target
      hierarchy is 'Leaves', no consolidated elements will be created."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process do?
        answer: The process creates new elements in a dimension hierarchy.
      - question: What happens if the parameter pEle contains a delimited list of
          elements?
        answer: If pEle contains a delimited list of elements, multiple elements will be
          created.
      - question: Are there any conditions where the process will abort?
        answer: Yes, the process will abort if a valid dimension name (pDim) and element
          list are not provided.
  - context: The process uses several global and constant variables, including
      StringGlobalVariable('sProcessReturnCode') and
      NumericGlobalVariable('nProcessReturnCode'). It uses 'cMsgErrorLevel' and
      'cMsgErrorContent' for logging error messages.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What types of global variables does the process use?
        answer: The process uses StringGlobalVariable and NumericGlobalVariable types
          for global variables.
      - question: How are error messages handled in the process?
        answer: Error messages are logged using 'cMsgErrorLevel' and 'cMsgErrorContent'.
      - question: What is the purpose of 'sProcessReturnCode' in the process?
        answer: "'sProcessReturnCode' is used to capture the process's return code as a
          string for reporting purposes."
  - context: Parameter validation is an essential part of the process. The
      parameters pDim, pHier, pEle, and pDelim are validated to ensure they meet
      specific criteria like non-emptiness and correct format.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the role of parameter validation in this process?
        answer: Parameter validation ensures that necessary parameters like pDim, pHier,
          pEle, and pDelim meet specific criteria and formats.
      - question: What happens if a parameter fails validation?
        answer: If a parameter fails validation, the process logs an error and may abort
          or break based on the error handling configuration.
      - question: What is the criteria for validating pDim?
        answer: pDim must be a non-empty string without wildcards or delimiters unless
          part of a hierarchy expression.
  - context: The process contains sections for Prolog, Metadaten, Daten, and Epilog.
      Each section serves different purposes such as initialization, metadata
      operations, data operations, and finalization.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the sections contained in the Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The sections include Prolog, Metadaten, Daten, and Epilog, each serving
          a unique purpose in the process.
      - question: What is the purpose of the Prolog section in the process?
        answer: The Prolog section is used for initialization, such as setting up global
          variables and defining constants.
      - question: What does the Epilog section do?
        answer: The Epilog section handles the finalization and cleanup tasks, such as
          error handling and logging outcomes.
  - context: If errors are encountered, the process will employ different error
      handling strategies based on the configuration, like ProcessQuit or
      ProcessBreak, and then log the error details.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle errors encountered during execution?
        answer: The process handles errors using strategies like ProcessQuit or
          ProcessBreak, depending on the error handling configuration.
      - question: What happens after an error is logged in the process?
        answer: After logging an error, the process might quit or break based on the
          configured error handling mechanism.
      - question: Is there provision for detailed error reporting in the process?
        answer: Yes, detailed error messages are logged, and the process provides
          information on the encountered issues through log outputs.
