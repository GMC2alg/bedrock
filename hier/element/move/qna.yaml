  - context: "This process will Add or Remove Element from a Consolidation in a
      Hierarchy. Valid dimension name (pDim), consolidated element name
      (pTgtConsol) and element name (pEle) otherwise the process will abort.
      Mode can be either Add to add or Remove to remove the element from a
      consolidation. Caution: Target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process do?
        answer: The process adds or removes an element from a consolidation in a
          hierarchy.
      - question: What are the valid input parameters for this process?
        answer: The valid input parameters are a dimension name (pDim), consolidated
          element name (pTgtConsol), and an element name (pEle).
      - question: What modes can be used in this process?
        answer: The modes that can be used are 'Add' to add or 'Remove' to remove the
          element from a consolidation.
  - context: "If a hierarchy has been passed as a dimension, it will handle the
      input error by splitting dim:hier into dimension & hierarchy. Validate
      dimension: If Trim(pDim) is empty, an error is logged stating no dimension
      specified. If the dimension does not exist, an error is logged."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle a hierarchy passed as a dimension?
        answer: It handles the input error by splitting dim:hier into dimension &
          hierarchy.
      - question: What happens if no dimension is specified?
        answer: If no dimension is specified, an error is logged stating 'No dimension
          specified.'
      - question: What occurs if the specified dimension does not exist?
        answer: An error is logged stating that the dimension does not exist on the
          server.
document_outline: The document outlines the functionality and operations of a
  Turbo Integrator process for managing elements within consolidations,
  detailing parameters and handling errors.
