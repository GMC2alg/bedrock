  - context: The process aims to ensure that the Leaves hierarchy remains
      synchronized with the main and alternate hierarchies of a dimension. It
      verifies that all leaf elements are present in the Leaves hierarchy when
      compared to the dimensions and hierarchies specified by the pDim and pHier
      parameters. Any missing leaf elements are automatically added to the
      Leaves hierarchy. This process is useful for identifying and addressing
      dimension issues during development or troubleshooting in production
      instances.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the primary goal of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The primary goal is to ensure that the Leaves hierarchy is synchronized
          with the main and alternate hierarchies of a dimension, containing all
          necessary leaf elements.
      - question: How does the process handle missing leaf elements?
        answer: The process automatically adds any missing leaf elements to the Leaves
          hierarchy.
      - question: In which scenarios is this process particularly useful?
        answer: The process is useful for identifying and addressing dimension issues
          during development or troubleshooting in production instances.
  - context: The description elaborates that if the Leaves hierarchy becomes out of
      sync and does not contain all leaf elements, the process will heal such
      dimensions and restore the synced state. This ensures that all leaf
      elements from each hierarchy also exist in the Leaves hierarchy of the
      specified dimension(s).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the Leaves hierarchy becomes out of sync?
        answer: The process will heal the dimensions and restore the synced state to
          ensure all leaf elements are present.
      - question: What is expected of the Leaves hierarchy in relation to other
          hierarchies?
        answer: The Leaves hierarchy should contain all leaf elements from all
          hierarchies of a dimension.
      - question: What does the process do if leaf elements are missing from the Leaves
          hierarchy?
        answer: It inserts the missing leaf elements into the Leaves hierarchy.
  - context: The process can handle both 'All dimensions' or a specific list of
      dimensions and hierarchies, including filtering hierarchies as per the
      parameters provided. It uses parameters like pDim and pHier to determine
      which dimensions and hierarchies need to be checked and potentially
      updated.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What options does the process support for dimension and hierarchy
          selection?
        answer: It supports handling both 'All dimensions' or a specific list of
          dimensions and hierarchies.
      - question: How does the process decide which dimensions and hierarchies to check?
        answer: It uses parameters like pDim and pHier to determine the dimensions and
          hierarchies to be checked.
      - question: Does the process consider hierarchies not specified in the parameters?
        answer: No, it only checks and updates the dimensions and hierarchies specified
          by the parameters.
  - context: If the process encounters any errors, it is set to terminate with a
      major error status. It logs error messages and can be configured for
      either strict error handling, where it terminates immediately, or less
      strict handling where it attempts to continue.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the process encounters an error?
        answer: The process is set to terminate with a major error status and logs the
          error messages.
      - question: How does the process handle errors in strict error handling mode?
        answer: In strict error handling mode, the process terminates immediately upon
          encountering an error.
      - question: Is less strict error handling supported by the process?
        answer: Yes, under less strict error handling, the process attempts to continue
          despite encountering errors.
  - context: The process outputs summary information that includes the number of
      dimensions scanned and modified. It logs specific messages detailing the
      modifications made to the dimensions, such as the addition of elements to
      the Leaves hierarchy or the number of dimensions that were out of sync and
      corrected.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What summary information does the process provide?
        answer: It provides information on the number of dimensions scanned and
          modified.
      - question: Does the process log details about modifications made?
        answer: Yes, it logs specific messages about modifications like adding elements
          to the Leaves hierarchy.
      - question: What does the process report on dimensions that were out of sync?
        answer: It reports the number of dimensions that were out of sync and
          subsequently corrected.
