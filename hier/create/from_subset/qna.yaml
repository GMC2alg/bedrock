  - context: This process will make a copy of an existing dimension subset, creating
      it as a new dimension hierarchy. Intended for Development but could be
      used in production too. Create a new hierarchy for testing or to reflect
      new business needs. Valid source dimension name (pSrcDim) and source
      subset (pSubset) are mandatory, otherwise the process will abort. If a
      source hierarchy name (pSrcHier) is specified, it needs to be valid,
      otherwise the process will abort. Target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'. If
      the target hierarchy already exists, then it will be overwritten.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process do?
        answer: The process makes a copy of an existing dimension subset, creating it as
          a new dimension hierarchy.
      - question: What are the mandatory fields for the Turbo Integrator process to run?
        answer: The mandatory fields are a valid source dimension name (pSrcDim) and
          source subset (pSubset).
      - question: Can the target hierarchy be 'Leaves'?
        answer: No, the target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'.
  - context: If a source hierarchy name (pSrcHier) is specified, it needs to be
      valid, otherwise the process will abort. The process is for Development
      but can be used in production as well. Target hierarchy cannot be
      'Leaves'. If the target hierarchy already exists, it will be overwritten.
      The source dimension name (pSrcDim) and source subset (pSubset) are
      mandatory for the process to continue.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the source hierarchy name specified is invalid?
        answer: The process will abort if the source hierarchy name specified is
          invalid.
      - question: Can this process be used in production?
        answer: Yes, the process is intended for Development but can also be used in
          production.
      - question: What happens if the target hierarchy already exists?
        answer: If the target hierarchy already exists, it will be overwritten.
  - context: The source dimension name (pSrcDim) and source subset (pSubset) are
      mandatory; otherwise, the process will abort. If a source hierarchy name
      (pSrcHier) is specified, it needs to be valid. The process can be used for
      creating new hierarchies for testing or to reflect changed business
      requirements. The target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why might one use this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: One might use this process to create new hierarchies for testing or to
          reflect changed business requirements.
      - question: What are the restrictions on the target hierarchy name?
        answer: The target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'.
      - question: What is required if you specify a source hierarchy name?
        answer: If you specify a source hierarchy name, it needs to be valid; otherwise,
          the process will abort.
document_outline: Develop an IBM Turbo Integrator process that creates a copy of
  an existing dimension subset and sets it as a new dimension hierarchy. Ensure
  necessary fields are provided to avoid process abortion.
