- context: This process will create a new hierarchy pHier in target dimension pDim.
    Intended primarily for Development but could be used in production. If dimension
    pDim doesn't exist, it will be created.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the process do?
    answer: The process creates a new hierarchy pHier in the target dimension pDim.
  - question: Can this process be used in production?
    answer: Yes, while it is intended primarily for development, it can also be used
      in production.
  - question: What happens if the dimension pDim doesn't exist?
    answer: If dimension pDim doesn't exist, it will be created.
- context: The process includes steps to create a new hierarchy for testing and to
    reflect new business needs.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the steps included in the process?
    answer: The process includes creating a new hierarchy for testing and reflecting
      new business needs.
  - question: Is one of the purposes of the process testing?
    answer: Yes, one of the purposes is to create a new hierarchy for testing.
  - question: How does the process adapt to new business needs?
    answer: The process allows for creating new hierarchies to reflect new business
      needs.
- context: If a blank delimiter is specified, it will be converted to a default '&'.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if a blank delimiter is specified?
    answer: If a blank delimiter is specified, it will be converted to the default
      '&'.
  - question: What is the default delimiter used in the process?
    answer: The default delimiter used in the process is '&'.
  - question: Can the user specify a custom delimiter?
    answer: Yes, but if a blank delimiter is specified, it defaults to '&'.
- context: The process includes logging functionalities for error and info messages,
    capturing user and process details.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Does the process have logging functionalities?
    answer: Yes, the process includes logging functionalities for error and info messages.
  - question: What details are captured in the logs?
    answer: The logs capture user and process details along with the messages.
  - question: Are error messages logged in the process?
    answer: Yes, error messages are logged for further analysis.
- context: The process checks for wildcard presence and processes accordingly, including
    creating dimensions if they don't exist.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How does the process handle wildcards?
    answer: The process checks for the presence of wildcards and processes dimensions
      accordingly.
  - question: What happens if a dimension does not exist?
    answer: If a dimension does not exist, the process creates it.
  - question: Does the process allow for dimension name validation?
    answer: Yes, the process validates dimension names before proceeding.
document_outline: This document outlines the implementation details of an IBM Turbo
  Integrator process, explaining its functionality and usage in development and production
  for creating new hierarchies in TM1 dimensions.
