  - context: This process will make an alternative hierarchy from a consolidated
      element and its children in the default hierarchy. Valid source dimension
      name (pSrcDim) and source subset (pSubset) are mandatory. If a source
      hierarchy name (pSrcHier) is specified, it must be valid. Target hierarchy
      cannot be 'Leaves'. If the target Hierarchy already exists, it will be
      overwritten.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The process creates an alternative hierarchy from a consolidated element
          and its children in the default hierarchy.
      - question: What are the mandatory inputs for this process?
        answer: A valid source dimension name (pSrcDim) and source subset (pSubset) are
          mandatory.
      - question: Can the target hierarchy be named 'Leaves'?
        answer: No, the target hierarchy cannot be named 'Leaves'.
  - context: "Use case: Intended for development but could be used in production
      too. Create a new hierarchy for testing or to reflect new business needs.
      Note: If a source hierarchy name (pSrcHier) is specified, it needs to be
      valid or the process will abort."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How is the process used in development?
        answer: The process can be used to create a new hierarchy for testing or to
          reflect new business needs.
      - question: What happens if an invalid source hierarchy name is specified?
        answer: The process will abort if an invalid source hierarchy name is specified.
      - question: Can this process be used in production?
        answer: Yes, it is intended for development but can be used in production too.
  - context: "Caution: If the target Hierarchy already exists, it will be
      overwritten. The process validates the inputs, such as checking the
      existence of dimensions and hierarchies, before proceeding with
      operations."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the target hierarchy already exists?
        answer: If the target hierarchy already exists, it will be overwritten.
      - question: Does the process validate inputs before proceeding?
        answer: Yes, the process validates inputs like dimensions and hierarchies before
          proceeding.
      - question: Is there a validation for the existence of required dimensions?
        answer: Yes, the process checks for the existence of required dimensions as part
          of validation.
  - context: "ExecuteProcess: Executes subprocesses like 'bedrock.hier.sub.create'
      to create subset and 'bedrock.hier.create.fromsubset' to create a
      hierarchy from the subset."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What subprocesses are executed in this process?
        answer: Subprocesses like 'bedrock.hier.sub.create' and
          'bedrock.hier.create.fromsubset' are executed.
      - question: What does 'bedrock.hier.sub.create' do?
        answer: "'bedrock.hier.sub.create' is used to create a subset."
      - question: What is the purpose of 'bedrock.hier.create.fromsubset'?
        answer: "'bedrock.hier.create.fromsubset' creates a hierarchy from the subset."
  - context: ProcessQuit and ProcessBreak control flow based on error handling. If
      strict error handling is enabled, the process quits on error; otherwise,
      it breaks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does strict error handling affect the process flow?
        answer: With strict error handling enabled, the process quits on encountering an
          error.
      - question: What happens when strict error handling is not enabled?
        answer: If strict error handling is not enabled, the process breaks instead of
          quitting when an error is encountered.
      - question: What process control structures are used for error handling?
        answer: ProcessQuit and ProcessBreak are used for controlling the flow based on
          error handling.
