  - context: This process will create a new dimension hierarchy from attribute
      values. Valid dimension name (pDim) and attribute name (pAttr) are
      mandatory, otherwise the process will abort.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process do?
        answer: The process creates a new dimension hierarchy from attribute values.
      - question: What are the required parameters for the process?
        answer: A valid dimension name (pDim) and attribute name (pAttr) are mandatory,
          otherwise the process will abort.
      - question: What happens if the mandatory parameters are not provided?
        answer: The process will abort if a valid dimension name (pDim) and attribute
          name (pAttr) are not provided.
  - context: It is assumed each element exists only once within the hierarchy. This
      should hold true except in exceptional circumstances.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is assumed about the elements within the hierarchy?
        answer: It is assumed each element exists only once within the hierarchy.
      - question: Are there any exceptions to the rule about element occurrence?
        answer: Yes, the rule should hold true except in exceptional circumstances.
      - question: What could cause the assumption about element uniqueness to not hold
          true?
        answer: Exceptional circumstances could cause each element not to exist only
          once within the hierarchy.
document_outline: This IBM Turbo Integrator process is intended to create a new
  dimension hierarchy based on attribute values. It is important that a valid
  dimension name and attribute name are provided; otherwise, the process will
  terminate. It is also assumed that each element appears only once within the
  hierarchy, except in special cases.
