  - context: "This process will delete all consolidated elements with no children in
      the target Hierarchy. Use case: Service process to clean-up consolidations
      after dimension changes. Note: Valid target dimension (pDim) must be
      supplied otherwise the process will terminate. Caution: Target hierarchy
      (pHier) cannot be `Leaves`."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The purpose of this process is to delete all consolidated elements with
          no children in the target hierarchy as a service process to clean-up
          consolidations after dimension changes.
      - question: What is a requirement for using this process?
        answer: A valid target dimension (pDim) must be supplied; otherwise, the process
          will terminate.
      - question: What restriction is placed on the target hierarchy (pHier)?
        answer: The target hierarchy (pHier) cannot be 'Leaves'.
  - context: Global variables are used, such as sProcessReturnCode and
      nProcessReturnCode. The process begins by setting nProcessReturnCode to 0,
      and constants are defined including cThisProcName, cUserName, and
      cTimeStamp.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are some of the global variables used in this process?
        answer: The process uses global variables such as sProcessReturnCode and
          nProcessReturnCode.
      - question: What is the initial value of nProcessReturnCode?
        answer: The initial value of nProcessReturnCode is set to 0.
      - question: What constants are defined at the beginning of the process?
        answer: Constants defined include cThisProcName, cUserName, and cTimeStamp.
  - context: The process logs output parameters and validates parameters such as the
      target dimension (pDim) and delimiter (pDelim). If any errors are detected
      during validation, the process takes actions like ProcessQuit or
      ProcessBreak.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process do if pDim is not specified?
        answer: If pDim is not specified, an error is logged, and the error handling
          logic is initiated.
      - question: What action is taken if a blank delimiter is specified?
        answer: If a blank delimiter is specified, it is converted to the default '&'.
      - question: What logging features are incorporated into the process?
        answer: The process logs output parameters for validation and errors using
          constructs like LogOutput.
  - context: The process loops through dimensions defined in pDim, creating subsets
      and validating hierarchy names. It also checks for and creates hierarchies
      if required, based on wildcard usage.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle wildcard dimensions?
        answer: The process creates subsets of dimensions using wildcard patterns to
          loop through dimensions in pDim.
      - question: What happens if a hierarchy specified does not exist in a dimension?
        answer: If a hierarchy specified using a non-wildcard pattern does not exist, it
          is created by the process.
      - question: What mechanism is used for dimension validation?
        answer: Dimension validation is carried out by checking DimensionExists(sDim)
          and returning errors if necessary.
  - context: The process deletes consolidated elements without children by iterating
      over dimensions and hierarchies, checking each element's type and child
      count. End-of-process actions handle final error messages and return
      codes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process identify elements for deletion?
        answer: The process identifies 'C' type elements with zero children for
          deletion.
      - question: What does the process do once it completes the deletion actions?
        answer: It logs the completion status and handles any remaining errors by
          setting process return codes and outputs messages.
      - question: Can you explain the end-of-process error handling?
        answer: The process checks if nErrors > 0, logs error messages and conditional
          actions like ProcessQuit if strict error handling is enabled.
document_outline: This document provides the description and functionality of a
  Turbo Integrator process designed to clean up consolidated elements without
  children in specified hierarchies. It includes parameter validation, logging,
  and error handling.
