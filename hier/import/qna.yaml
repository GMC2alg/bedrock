  - context: "This process will import Dimension elements into a specified Hierarchy
      from a File. The format of the file includes various lines: The first line
      contains metadata of the file with summary information about the
      dimension, hierarchy, number of elements, and date/time of file creation.
      The second line specifies the source dimension and hierarchy. The third
      line describes the dimension sort order. The fourth and fifth lines are
      reserved for future development. The sixth line includes the header for
      elements export, while the seventh line and following represent the
      exported element data."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process import?
        answer: The process imports Dimension elements into a specified Hierarchy from a
          File.
      - question: What information is on the first line of the file?
        answer: The first line contains metadata of the file with summary information
          about the dimension, hierarchy, number of elements, and date/time of
          file creation.
      - question: What does the third line of the file describe?
        answer: The third line describes the dimension sort order.
  - context: Use cases for this process include restoring a dimension from a backup
      and quick replication of a large dimension. A valid dimension name (pDim)
      is mandatory, otherwise, the process will abort. If needed, a custom
      delimiter might be used by specifying the parameter pDelim value as either
      a single character or a 3-digit decimal ASCII code.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are some use cases for this process?
        answer: Some use cases include restoring a dimension from a backup and quick
          replication of a large dimension.
      - question: What is required for the process to not abort?
        answer: A valid dimension name (pDim) is mandatory for the process to not abort.
      - question: How can a custom delimiter be specified?
        answer: A custom delimiter can be specified by giving the parameter pDelim value
          as either a single character or a 3-digit decimal ASCII code.
  - context: The pUnwind parameter provides options to 1 (unwind) or 0 (delete)
      elements in the target dimension. Default is to unwind, but care should be
      taken when using option 0 to avoid data loss. The process was redesigned
      in Bedrock4 but can process dimension extracts from prior versions of
      Bedrock in legacy mode (pLegacy = 1).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the pUnwind parameter do?
        answer: The pUnwind parameter provides options to 1 (unwind) or 0 (delete)
          elements in the target dimension.
      - question: What is the default option for pUnwind?
        answer: The default option for pUnwind is 1, which means to unwind elements.
      - question: Can the process handle dimension extracts from prior versions?
        answer: Yes, the process can handle dimension extracts from prior versions of
          Bedrock in legacy mode (pLegacy = 1).
  - context: "### Validate Parameters - If the dimension is not specified, an error
      is logged and nErrors is set to 1. If the source path does not exist, an
      error is logged, and nErrors is incremented. The process checks for a
      valid legacy file format and constructs the full export filename including
      the path."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the dimension is not specified?
        answer: If the dimension is not specified, an error is logged and nErrors is set
          to 1.
      - question: What occurs if the source path doesn't exist?
        answer: If the source path doesn't exist, an error is logged, and nErrors is
          incremented.
      - question: What does the process check for regarding the legacy file format?
        answer: The process checks for a valid legacy file format and constructs the
          full export filename including the path.
  - context: "### Prepare target dimension - If the hierarchy exists in the
      specified dimension and unwind is selected, the process calls
      }bedrock.hier.unwind to unwind the dimension elements. If no hierarchy
      exists, it creates a new one using }bedrock.hier.create. If errors are
      found, the process is terminated or aborted based on the error handling
      settings."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the hierarchy exists and unwind is selected?
        answer: If the hierarchy exists and unwind is selected, the process calls
          }bedrock.hier.unwind to unwind the dimension elements.
      - question: What is done if no hierarchy exists?
        answer: If no hierarchy exists, the process creates a new one using
          }bedrock.hier.create.
      - question: What happens if errors are found during preparation?
        answer: If errors are found, the process is terminated or aborted based on the
          error handling settings.

  elements from a file to a specified hierarchy, including use cases, parameter
  validation, and error handling.
