- context: 'This process deletes public subsets from selected dimensions and hierarchies.
    Dimensions, hierarchies, and subsets can be specified as a delimited list. Wildcards
    are accepted as '*' and '?' characters. Note: - pDim: To specify which dimensions
    to delete subsets from use the pDim parameter. - To delete subsets from a single
    dimension only just specify that dimension name e.g. 'Product'. - To delete
    subsets from multiple dimensions specify each dimension name separated by a delimiter
    e.g. 'Product & Customer & Account'. - To delete subsets from all dimensions
    then leave pDim parameter blank or supply 'ALL'.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How do you specify which dimensions to delete subsets from?
    answer: You specify the dimensions using the pDim parameter. You can provide a
      single dimension or multiple dimensions by separating them with a delimiter.
      To apply to all dimensions, you can leave the parameter blank or use 'ALL'.
  - question: Are wildcards accepted in the parameter values for specifying dimensions?
    answer: Yes, wildcards '*' and '?' are accepted in the parameter values.
  - question: What should you do if you want to delete subsets from multiple dimensions?
    answer: Specify each dimension name separated by a delimiter e.g., 'Product &
      Customer & Account'.
- context: '- pHier: To specify which hierarchies to delete subsets from use the pHier
    parameter. - To specify the default hierarchy, leave the parameter value empty.
    - To specify all available hierarchies, set parameter value to '*'.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How do you specify that subsets should be deleted from all hierarchies?
    answer: Set the pHier parameter value to '*'.
  - question: What happens if you leave the pHier parameter value empty?
    answer: It defaults to deleting subsets from the default hierarchy.
  - question: Can you use a wildcard to specify hierarchies?
    answer: Yes, wildcards are allowed and all hierarchies matching the wildcard string
      will be processed.
- context: '- pSub: To specify which subsets to delete use the pSub parameter. - This
    parameter must be specified, a blank value will cause the process to terminate.
    - To delete a single subset only just specify that subset name e.g. 'SmallProducts'.
    - To delete multiple subsets, specify each subset name separated by a delimiter
    e.g. 'SmallProducts & LargeProducts'.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if the pSub parameter is left blank?
    answer: The process will terminate because this parameter must be specified.
  - question: How do you specify the deletion of multiple subsets?
    answer: Separate each subset name with a delimiter, e.g., 'SmallProducts & LargeProducts'.
  - question: Is it mandatory to specify the pSub parameter?
    answer: Yes, it is mandatory and cannot be left blank.
- context: '- pDelim: The delimiter is used when specifying multiple dimensions and/or
    multiple subsets. - The default delimiter is '&'. Any delimiter can be used
    by specifying a value for pDelim. - Choose a delimiter that won't be used in
    either the wildcard search strings or dimension names.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the default delimiter for separating items?
    answer: The default delimiter is '&'.
  - question: Can you change the default delimiter?
    answer: Yes, any delimiter can be used by specifying it in the pDelim parameter.
  - question: What should be considered when choosing a custom delimiter?
    answer: Ensure that the chosen delimiter isn't used in wildcard search strings
      or dimension names.
- context: '- pMode: - When set to a value less or equal to '1': all found subsets
    will be destroyed. - When set to a value of '2': all found subsets will be emptied.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What happens if you set the pMode parameter to a value less or equal
      to '1'?
    answer: All found subsets will be destroyed.
  - question: What is the effect of setting pMode to '2'?
    answer: All found subsets will be emptied but not destroyed.
  - question: When using pMode, what is the difference between values '1' and '2'?
    answer: Value '1' destroys subsets, while value '2' empties them.
