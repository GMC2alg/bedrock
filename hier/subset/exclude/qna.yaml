  - context: "This process will remove specified elements from a subset in a
      Hierarchy of target Dimension. Wildcard characters `*`and `?` are accepted
      in list of elements to be excluded. If a leaf level element is specified,
      it will be removed on its own. If a consolidated element is specified, it
      will be removed as well as its descendants. Caution: Target hierarchy
      cannot be `Leaves`."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process do with leaf level elements?
        answer: If a leaf level element is specified, it will be removed on its own.
      - question: Are wildcard characters supported in the elements to be excluded?
        answer: Yes, wildcard characters `*` and `?` are accepted in the list of
          elements to be excluded.
      - question: What happens if a consolidated element is specified for removal?
        answer: If a consolidated element is specified, it will be removed as well as
          its descendants.
  - context: The process includes global variables and constants such as
      cThisProcName for the process name, cUserName for the TM1 user, and
      cTimeStamp for the current timestamp. The constants are used for logging
      and process identification.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the constant cThisProcName represent?
        answer: The constant cThisProcName represents the name of the current process.
      - question: How is the current user stored in the process?
        answer: The current user is stored in the constant cUserName.
      - question: What is the purpose of cTimeStamp in the process?
        answer: cTimeStamp is used to store the current timestamp for logging purposes.
  - context: The process verifies parameters such as dimensions, hierarchies,
      subsets, and elements. It ensures that a target dimension and hierarchy
      exist, checks the validity of the subset, and validates the elements
      specified for exclusion.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What checks are performed to validate dimensions?
        answer: The process checks if a dimension is specified and exists in the system.
      - question: How does the process handle hierarchy validation?
        answer: The process ensures that the specified hierarchy exists and that it is
          not 'Leaves'.
      - question: What is verified for the elements to be excluded?
        answer: The process checks if elements are specified for exclusion and ensures
          their validity.
  - context: Logging and error handling are integral parts of the process. The
      process logs various levels of information and handles errors by stopping
      execution if required. It also formats error messages using predefined
      templates.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle errors?
        answer: The process logs errors and can stop execution based on the value of
          pStrictErrorHandling.
      - question: What kind of information is logged by the process?
        answer: The process logs include informational messages and errors using
          predefined templates.
      - question: Does the process support error handling customization?
        answer: Yes, the process supports error handling customization through the
          pStrictErrorHandling parameter.
  - context: The process uses a temporary subset approach to manage exclusions using
      wildcard characters. It creates a temporary subset, performs operations to
      identify and exclude matching elements, and then destroys the temporary
      subset once completed.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Why is a temporary subset used in the process?
        answer: A temporary subset is used to manage exclusions when wildcard characters
          are involved.
      - question: What happens to the temporary subset after exclusions are processed?
        answer: The temporary subset is destroyed after the required operations are
          completed.
      - question: How are elements processed when wildcard characters are involved?
        answer: Matching elements are identified in the temporary subset and then
          excluded from the main subset.
document_outline: The document outlines a Turbo Integrator process for removing
  specified elements from a subset within a hierarchy of a target dimension. It
  covers supporting wildcard exclusions, error handling, logging, and the usage
  of temporary subsets.
