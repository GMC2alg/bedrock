  - context: "The process will create a dynamic subset from an MDX expression that
      evaluates to a non-empty set in the specified dimension. Intended for
      Production & Development. Note: Valid dimension name (pDim) is mandatory,
      otherwise the process will abort. If the MDX does not compile or produces
      an empty set, the process will error. If convert to static
      (pConvertToStatic) is set to 1, then the MDX subset will be replaced by a
      static subset."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the main function of the Turbo Integrator process described?
        answer: The main function is to create a dynamic subset from an MDX expression
          that evaluates to a non-empty set in the specified dimension.
      - question: In what environments is this Turbo Integrator process intended to be
          used?
        answer: This process is intended for use in both Production and Development
          environments.
      - question: What happens if an invalid dimension name is provided to the process?
        answer: The process will abort if an invalid dimension name (pDim) is provided.
  - context: If the MDX does not compile or produces an empty set, an error will
      occur. If convert to static (pConvertToStatic) is set to 1, the MDX subset
      will be replaced by a static subset.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What occurs if the MDX expression does not compile?
        answer: If the MDX expression does not compile or produces an empty set, an
          error will occur in the process.
      - question: What is the function of the 'pConvertToStatic' parameter?
        answer: If 'pConvertToStatic' is set to 1, the MDX subset will be replaced by a
          static subset.
      - question: Does the process replace MDX expressions with static subsets by
          default?
        answer: No, replacing MDX expressions with static subsets occurs only if
          'pConvertToStatic' is explicitly set to 1.
