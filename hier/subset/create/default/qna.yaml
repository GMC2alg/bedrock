  - context: "This process will create a static subset in a Hierarchy of target
      Dimension. It uses multiple parameters to determine what elements to
      include in the subset: - pConsol: If specified, only elements that are
      descendants of the consol will be included. Otherwise, this filter is
      ignored. - pAttr: If specified, only elements with a value equivalent to
      pAttrValue are included; otherwise, this filter is ignored. - pLevelFrom:
      Only elements with a level greater than or equal to pLevelFrom are
      included. - pLevelTo: Only elements with a level less than or equal to
      pLevelTo are included. - pExclusions: If specified, elements (separated by
      a delimiter) are excluded from the subset. Wildcards `*` and `?` are
      accepted. - pAddToSubset: If the subset already exists, this parameter
      controls whether elements are added (value 1) or if a new subset is
      created (value 0)."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the parameter pConsol do in the Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The parameter pConsol specifies that only elements which are descendants
          of the consol will be included in the subset.
      - question: How does the process handle the parameter pAttr?
        answer: If pAttr is specified, only elements with a value equivalent to
          pAttrValue are included in the subset. Otherwise, this filter is
          ignored.
      - question: What happens if a subset already exists and pAddToSubset is set to 0?
        answer: If a subset already exists and pAddToSubset is set to 0, a new subset
          will be created instead of adding elements to the existing subset.
  - context: The process includes validation steps for parameters. For example, it
      ensures dimensions and hierarchies are correctly specified and verifies
      subset existence. It handles errors via logging messages and can quit or
      break the process depending on error handling settings.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How are validation errors handled in this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: Validation errors are logged, and depending on the strict error handling
          setting, the process may either quit or break.
      - question: What checks are performed on the dimension parameter?
        answer: The process checks if a dimension is specified and if it exists. If a
          hierarchy has been passed incorrectly with the dimension, it will
          extract and validate it separately.
      - question: What does the process do if no subset is specified?
        answer: If no subset is specified, it logs an error message indicating that no
          subset is specified.
  - context: The process contains sections for Prolog, Metadaten, and Epilog. It has
      a systematic approach for preparing subsets, setting aliases, and
      executing exclusion processes. It ends by logging completion messages and
      handling final errors.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the role of the Prolog section in this process?
        answer: The Prolog section validates parameters, sets up global variables,
          prepares subsets, and logs initial information.
      - question: What does the process do in the Metadaten section?
        answer: In the Metadaten section, the process adds elements to the subset,
          checks that elements meet specified criteria, and logs any issues
          encountered.
      - question: How does the process conclude in the Epilog section?
        answer: The Epilog section handles final error messages, logs processing
          actions, and executes exclusion processes where necessary.
document_outline: This document outlines the implementation of an IBM Turbo
  Integrator process that creates a static subset in a dimension's hierarchy by
  applying various filters and parameters.
