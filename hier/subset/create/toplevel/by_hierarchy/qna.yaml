seed_examples:
- context: This process will Create a Top Level Hierarchy by N-Level Elements that
    is a subset of all 'top node' elements (Consolidated elements that have no parents).
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the turbo integrator process?
    answer: The purpose of the process is to create a Top Level Hierarchy by N-Level
      Elements, which is a subset of all 'top node' elements, i.e., consolidated elements
      that have no parents.
  - question: What are 'top node' elements in this context?
    answer: "'Top node' elements are consolidated elements that have no parents."
  - question: How does the process handle hierarchies?
    answer: The process aims to create a hierarchy from N-Level Elements that form
      a subset of 'top node' elements.
- context: StringGlobalVariable('sProcessReturnCode'); NumericGlobalVariable('nProcessReturnCode');
    nProcessReturnCode= 0;
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the global variables defined in this process?
    answer: "The process defines two global variables: 'sProcessReturnCode' as a
      string and 'nProcessReturnCode' as a numeric global variable."
  - question: What is the initial value of 'nProcessReturnCode'?
    answer: The initial value of 'nProcessReturnCode' is set to 0.
  - question: How are global variables used in this code?
    answer: Global variables are used to store values across different parts of the
      process, such as process return codes.
- context: cLogInfo = 'Process:%cThisProcName% run with parameters pDim:%pDim%, pHier:%pHier%,
    pSub:%pSub%, pConvertToStatic:%pConvertToStatic%, pAlias:%pAlias%, pTemp:%pTemp%.';
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What does the 'cLogInfo' constant represent?
    answer: The 'cLogInfo' constant is a string template for logging information about
      the process run with specific parameters like pDim, pHier, pSub, etc.
  - question: Which parameters' values are logged in 'cLogInfo'?
    answer: "'cLogInfo' logs the parameter values for pDim, pHier, pSub, pConvertToStatic,
      pAlias, and pTemp."
  - question: How is process information logged in this code?
    answer: Process information is logged using a string template stored in the 'cLogInfo'
      constant, which is populated with runtime parameter values.
