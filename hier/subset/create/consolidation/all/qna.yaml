  - context: "This process will create a static subset in a Hierarchy of target
      Dimension that consists of all descendants of a specified consolidated
      element, including consolidated elements. Note: - pExclusions: If
      pExclusions is specified then the elements (separated by a delimiter) will
      be excluded from the subset. Wildcards characters `*` and `?` are
      accepted. - pAddToSubset : If the specified subset already exists then
      this parameter will control whether elements will be added to the existing
      subset (value 1) or a new subset will be created (value 0). Caution:
      Number of consolidated levels that are processed is limited to maximum of
      99."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The purpose of this process is to create a static subset in a Hierarchy
          of target Dimension that includes all descendants of a specified
          consolidated element.
      - question: What happens if pExclusions is specified?
        answer: If pExclusions is specified, the elements (separated by a delimiter)
          will be excluded from the subset, and wildcards like '*' and '?' are
          accepted.
      - question: How does the pAddToSubset parameter affect the process?
        answer: The pAddToSubset parameter determines if elements will be added to the
          existing subset (value 1) or if a new subset will be created (value
          0).
  - context: "Global Variables: sProcessReturnCode and nProcessReturnCode are
      defined with initial value 0. Constants such as cThisProcName, cUserName,
      cMsgErrorLevel, cMsgErrorShell, cMsgErrorContent, and cLogInfo are
      utilized for logging and error handling."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the initial value of nProcessReturnCode?
        answer: The initial value of nProcessReturnCode is 0.
      - question: What does cMsgErrorShell represent?
        answer: cMsgErrorShell represents a constant string used for logging an error
          message if the process execution fails.
      - question: How is cLogInfo used in the process?
        answer: cLogInfo is a constant string that logs information about the parameters
          used when the process runs.
  - context: In the Epilog section, return code and final error message handling are
      implemented. If any errors are encountered, they are logged with an error
      message, and the process may quit depending on pStrictErrorHandling.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if errors are encountered in the process?
        answer: If errors are encountered, they are logged with an error message, and
          the process may quit if pStrictErrorHandling is set to 1.
      - question: How is nProcessReturnCode set if no errors occur?
        answer: If no errors occur, nProcessReturnCode is set to 1, indicating the
          process completed successfully.
      - question: What message is logged if the process completes without errors?
        answer: A message stating that the process successfully created a subset from
          the dimension is logged if no errors occur.
