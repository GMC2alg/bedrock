  - context: "This process creates static subsets named 'All level <nn>' for the
      specified consolidation levels in a Hierarchy of a Dimension. Note: Option
      to sort subset is available only for sorting per element principal names.
      Caution: Target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The purpose of this process is to create static subsets named 'All level
          <nn>' for specified consolidation levels in a Hierarchy of a
          Dimension.
      - question: Can the target hierarchy be 'Leaves'?
        answer: No, the target hierarchy cannot be 'Leaves'.
      - question: Is sorting available for the subsets created by this process?
        answer: Yes, sorting is available but only for sorting per element principal
          names.
  - context: "Global Variables and Constants:
      StringGlobalVariable('sProcessReturnCode');
      NumericGlobalVariable('nProcessReturnCode'); nProcessReturnCode= 0;
      Constants include cThisProcName, cUserName, cTimeStamp, cRandomInt,
      cTempSub, cMsgErrorLevel, cMsgErrorContent, cLogInfo, cAttributeDim, and
      cSubs."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are some of the constants defined in the Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: Some of the constants include cThisProcName, cUserName, cTimeStamp,
          cRandomInt, cTempSub, cMsgErrorLevel, cMsgErrorContent, cLogInfo,
          cAttributeDim, and cSubs.
      - question: What is the initial value set for the global variable
          nProcessReturnCode?
        answer: The initial value set for the global variable nProcessReturnCode is 0.
      - question: What type of global variable is sProcessReturnCode?
        answer: sProcessReturnCode is a StringGlobalVariable.
  - context: "Validate Parameters Section: The process checks if a dimension has
      been specified and if it exists. It also checks for hierarchy validity,
      ensuring the target is not 'Leaves'. Alias and pTemp parameters are also
      validated."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What parameters are validated in this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: The parameters validated include dimension, hierarchy, alias, and pTemp.
      - question: How does the process handle dimension and hierarchy validation?
        answer: The process checks if a dimension has been specified and exists, and
          ensures that the hierarchy is valid and not 'Leaves'.
      - question: What is ensured before proceeding with alias validation?
        answer: Before alias validation, it is ensured that attributes exist for the
          dimension, the alias exists within the dimension, and the alias is
          correctly typed.
  - context: "Build Subset Section: If no errors are found, the process iterates
      through the hierarchy levels to create or update subsets using MDX
      expressions, optionally converting them to static subsets if required."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How are subsets created or updated in the process?
        answer: Subsets are created or updated by iterating through hierarchy levels and
          using MDX expressions, with an option to convert them to static
          subsets.
      - question: What happens if pConvertStatic is set to 1?
        answer: If pConvertStatic is set to 1, the subset is converted to a static
          subset.
      - question: What does the process do if errors are found before building subsets?
        answer: If errors are found, the process does not proceed with building subsets.
  - context: "Error Handling and Logging: The process includes error handling to log
      error messages and determine return codes. Successful execution logs a
      message indicating the created subsets."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process handle errors and logging?
        answer: Errors are handled by logging error messages and setting return codes.
          Successful execution logs a message with details of created subsets.
      - question: What happens if the process encounters errors?
        answer: If errors are encountered, an error message is logged and the process
          may terminate early if strict error handling is enabled.
      - question: What information is logged on successful execution?
        answer: On successful execution, a log message indicates which subsets were
          created from which dimension.
