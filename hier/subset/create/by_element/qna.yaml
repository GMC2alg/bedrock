  - context: "This process will create a static subset in a Hierarchy of target
      Dimension based on a list of supplied elements. - pAddToSubset: If the
      specified subset already exists then this parameter will control whether
      elements will be added to the existing subset (value 1) or a new subset
      will be created (value 0). - pExpandConsol: If the specified list of
      elements contains consolidated elements they will be replaced with their
      leaf level descendants. Caution: Process doesn't accept wildcards in
      element names."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the process do?
        answer: The process creates a static subset in a Hierarchy of the specified
          target Dimension based on a list of supplied elements.
      - question: What happens if pAddToSubset is set to 1?
        answer: If pAddToSubset is set to 1 and the subset already exists, elements will
          be added to the existing subset.
      - question: Can wildcards be used in element names?
        answer: No, the process does not accept wildcards in element names.
  - context: "A hierarchy has been passed as dimension. Handle the input error by
      splitting dim:hier into dimension & hierarchy. Validate dimension: If the
      dimension does not exist, an error is logged. Validate hierarchy: An error
      is logged if the hierarchy specified does not exist within the dimension."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How is a hierarchy passed as a dimension handled?
        answer: It is handled by splitting dim:hier into dimension and hierarchy to
          address the input error.
      - question: What happens if the dimension does not exist?
        answer: An error is logged indicating that the dimension is invalid.
      - question: What occurs if the specified hierarchy does not exist within the
          dimension?
        answer: An error is logged indicating an invalid dimension hierarchy.
  - context: "Validate subset: An error is logged if no subset is specified.
      Validate elements: An error is logged if no elements are specified.
      Validate delimiter: If no delimiter is set, it defaults to '&'. Validate
      add to subset: An error is logged if pAddToSubset is not 0 or 1."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What error is logged if no subset is specified?
        answer: An error stating 'No subset specified' is logged.
      - question: What is the default delimiter if none is specified?
        answer: The default delimiter is '&'.
      - question: What occurs if pAddToSubset is not 0 or 1?
        answer: An error is logged indicating an invalid value for pAddToSubset.
  - context: "Validate expand consolidations: An error is logged if pExpandConsol is
      not 0, 1, or 2. Validate Alias: Checks are conducted to ensure attributes
      exist and the alias is valid in the dimension. Validate pTemp: An error is
      logged if pTemp is not 0 or 1."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the valid values for pExpandConsol?
        answer: The valid values are 0, 1, and 2.
      - question: What validation is performed for an alias?
        answer: It checks if attributes exist for the dimension and if the alias is
          valid and is truly an alias within the dimension.
      - question: What error is logged if pTemp is not 0 or 1?
        answer: An error is logged indicating a wrong parameter value for pTemp.
  - context: "Prepare subset: If the subset exists, it checks nSubsetSize based on
      pAddToSubset. Insert elements: Elements are inserted into the subset while
      handling consolidated elements based on pExpandConsol parameter."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if the subset already exists with pAddToSubset not equal
          to 1?
        answer: The elements of the existing subset are deleted before proceeding.
      - question: How are consolidated elements handled during insertion?
        answer: Consolidated elements are expanded into their leaf level descendants
          depending on the pExpandConsol parameter.
      - question: What is nSubsetSize?
        answer: nSubsetSize is the size of the subset which is checked to determine the
          actions based on pAddToSubset.
