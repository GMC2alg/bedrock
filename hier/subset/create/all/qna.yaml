  - context: "This process will create a static subset in Hierarchy of a Dimension
      that consists of all elements. This process uses modification parameters
      to determine what to include in the subset: - pExclusions: If pExclusions
      is specified then the elements (separated by a delimiter) will be excluded
      from the subset. Wildcards characters `*` and `?` are accepted. -
      pAddToSubset: If the specified subset already exists then this parameter
      will control whether elements will be added to the existing subset (value
      1) or a new subset will be created (value 0)."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process create in the dimension
          hierarchy?
        answer: The Turbo Integrator process creates a static subset consisting of all
          elements in the hierarchy of a dimension.
      - question: How can elements be excluded from the subset in the Turbo Integrator
          process?
        answer: Elements can be excluded from the subset by specifying them in
          `pExclusions`, separated by a delimiter. Wildcard characters `*` and
          `?` are also accepted.
      - question: What happens if the specified subset already exists and pAddToSubset
          is set to 1?
        answer: If the specified subset already exists and pAddToSubset is set to 1,
          elements will be added to the existing subset.
  - context: pExclusions is a parameter that allows elements to be excluded from the
      subset. It accepts wildcard characters such as `*` and `?`, providing
      flexibility in specifying elements to exclude.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the purpose of the pExclusions parameter?
        answer: The purpose of the pExclusions parameter is to allow elements to be
          excluded from the subset being created.
      - question: Does pExclusions support wildcard characters?
        answer: Yes, pExclusions supports wildcard characters such as `*` and `?` for
          flexible element specification.
      - question: How are elements specified in pExclusions?
        answer: Elements in pExclusions are specified by separating them with a
          delimiter.
  - context: pAddToSubset is a parameter that determines whether elements will be
      added to an existing subset or a new subset will be created. If set to 1,
      elements are added to the existing subset; if set to 0, a new subset is
      created.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the pAddToSubset parameter control?
        answer: The pAddToSubset parameter controls whether elements are added to an
          existing subset or if a new subset is created.
      - question: What happens when pAddToSubset is set to 0?
        answer: When pAddToSubset is set to 0, a new subset is created instead of adding
          elements to an existing one.
      - question: If adding elements to an existing subset is desired, how should
          pAddToSubset be set?
        answer: If adding elements to an existing subset is desired, pAddToSubset should
          be set to 1.
  - context: The code includes error handling mechanisms that log messages and
      handle errors if they occur. Key error handling involves the use of
      nProcessReturnCode and sProcessReturnCode that are utilized to determine
      the success or failure of the process.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the code handle errors?
        answer: The code handles errors by using nProcessReturnCode and
          sProcessReturnCode to log messages and determine the success or
          failure of the process.
      - question: What is used to log messages in the code?
        answer: The code uses a construct involving LogOutput and Expand to log messages
          regarding process execution and errors.
      - question: What happens if nErrors is greater than 0?
        answer: If nErrors is greater than 0, error messages are logged, and the process
          return code signifies errors. If pStrictErrorHandling is enabled,
          ProcessQuit is called.
  - context: The process relies on a set of parameters such as pDim, pHier, pSub,
      among others, for its execution. LogOutput is used to output the parameter
      values, contributing to process tracking and debugging.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are pDim, pHier, and pSub used for in the process?
        answer: pDim, pHier, and pSub are parameters used to specify the dimension,
          hierarchy, and subset involved in the process.
      - question: How does the process output its parameters?
        answer: The process uses LogOutput to output the parameter values for tracking
          and debugging purposes.
      - question: Why is LogOutput important in the context of this process?
        answer: LogOutput is important because it helps in tracking and debugging by
          providing information about parameter values and process execution
          details.
