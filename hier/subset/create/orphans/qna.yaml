  - context: "This process will create a static subset in a Hierarchy of target
      Dimension that consists of all orphan elements. Orphan element is defined
      as: - Consolidated element without children. - Leaf element without
      parent."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does the Turbo Integrator process create?
        answer: The Turbo Integrator process creates a static subset in a hierarchy of
          target dimension consisting of all orphan elements.
      - question: How is an orphan element defined in this Turbo Integrator process?
        answer: An orphan element is defined as a consolidated element without children
          or a leaf element without a parent.
      - question: In this process, what types of elements can be considered orphans?
        answer: In this process, both consolidated elements without children and leaf
          elements without parents are considered orphans.
  - context: Orphan C Elements refer to Consolidated elements that have no children,
      while Orphan N Elements refer to Leaf elements that have no parents. The
      process deletes existing orphan subsets or creates new ones if they do not
      exist.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are Orphan C Elements in this context?
        answer: Orphan C Elements are consolidated elements that have no children.
      - question: What action does the process take if existing orphan subsets are found?
        answer: If existing orphan subsets are found, the process deletes them.
      - question: Are new orphan subsets created if they do not exist?
        answer: Yes, new orphan subsets are created if they do not exist.
  - context: The process includes validating parameters such as dimension and
      hierarchy, and outputs error messages if validation fails. These
      validations help prevent errors in the creation of orphan subsets.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if parameter validation fails in the process?
        answer: If parameter validation fails, the process outputs error messages.
      - question: Why are parameter validations important in this process?
        answer: Parameter validations are important to prevent errors in the creation of
          orphan subsets.
      - question: What are some parameters that the process validates?
        answer: The process validates parameters such as dimension and hierarchy.
  - context: "The process populates subsets with elements: for N elements, those
      with no parents (leaf nodes); for C elements, those with no children
      (consolidated nodes)."
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the process populate subsets?
        answer: The process populates subsets with N elements (leaf nodes with no
          parents) and C elements (consolidated nodes with no children).
      - question: What criteria are used to determine N elements for populating subsets?
        answer: N elements for populating subsets are determined by having no parents.
      - question: What criteria are used to determine C elements for populating subsets?
        answer: C elements for populating subsets are determined by having no children.
  - context: If no orphans are found, the process will destroy empty subsets. This
      ensures that unnecessary data is removed from the system.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What action is taken if no orphan elements are found?
        answer: If no orphan elements are found, the process will destroy the empty
          subsets.
      - question: Why does the process destroy empty subsets?
        answer: The process destroys empty subsets to ensure that unnecessary data is
          removed from the system.
      - question: What does the process ensure by destroying empty subsets?
        answer: By destroying empty subsets, the process ensures that unnecessary data
          is removed from the system.
