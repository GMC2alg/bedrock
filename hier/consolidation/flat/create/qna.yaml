- context: 'The process adds the consolidated element pTgtConsol in the dimension
    hierarchy. Use case: Intended for development but can also be used in production.
    1/ Create a new hierarchy for testing. 2/ Create a new hierarchy to reflect new
    business needs. Note: If source parent element (pSrcConsol) is defined, all its
    leaf elements will be copied to target parent element consolidation. Otherwise,
    all leaf elements in the dimension hierarchy will be added into target parent
    element consolidation. Valid source dimension name (pDim), hierarchy (pHier) and
    target parent element (pTgtConsol) are mandatory otherwise the process will abort.
    The weight of all added elements into target parent consolidation will be assigned
    according to pWeight parameter value. Caution: If the target element pTgtConsol
    exists in the hierarchy, it will be overwritten.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the main purpose of the process described?
    answer: The process adds the consolidated element pTgtConsol in the dimension
      hierarchy, intended for development or production use.
  - question: What happens if a source parent element is defined?
    answer: All its leaf elements will be copied to the target parent element consolidation.
  - question: What must be provided for the process to avoid aborting?
    answer: Valid source dimension name (pDim), hierarchy (pHier) and target parent
      element (pTgtConsol).
- context: Valid source dimension name (pDim), hierarchy (pHier), and target parent
    element (pTgtConsol) are mandatory, otherwise the process will abort. Weight of
    all added elements into target parent consolidation will be assigned according
    to pWeight parameter value.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are mandatory requirements to avoid process abortion?
    answer: Valid source dimension name (pDim), hierarchy (pHier), and target parent
      element (pTgtConsol) are mandatory.
  - question: How is the weight assigned to the added elements?
    answer: The weight is assigned according to the pWeight parameter value.
  - question: What happens if any of the required parameters are missing?
    answer: The process will abort.
